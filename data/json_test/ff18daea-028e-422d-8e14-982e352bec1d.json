Their value proposition is that design + business + data + execution live under one roof. That means a Design Director at Kurppa Hosk would not only lead visual or product design, but also influence brand strategy, experience design, communications, and possibly packaging/product experience.\n\n## \ufffd\ufffd What to ask \u2014 high-value questions for the Design Director briefing\n\nWhen you sit down with them, framing your questions to reflect both your design sensibility and strategic, commercial awareness will help you stand out. Here are some high-impact questions:\n\n1. **\u201cHow do you currently balance strategic brand work vs execution (identity / packaging / digital / communications)? And what does success look like \u2014 for both short-term deliverables and long-term brand equity?\u201d**\n   - This shows you want to understand not just project-level work but how design contributes to broader brand/business goals.\n2. **\u201cWith Kurppa Hosk\u2019s growth and newly expanded services (including physical packaging and experience design via Goods), how do you see the role of Design Director evolving? What\u2019s the vision for the design leadership in the next 12 \u2013 24 months?\u201d**\n   - Because they\u2019re scaling and broadening scope: good to show you care about shaping the future, not just delivering.\n3. **\u201cGiven Eidra\u2019s model \u2014 combining consulting, data, creativity and engineering \u2014 how are design decisions informed by data and business strategy? What\u2019s the collaboration model between design, data, and consulting teams?\u201d**\n   - Signals that you understand hybrid consultancy/design operations; and that design should be integrated with business/data work.\n4. **\u201cWhat kind of design governance, processes, or systems do you currently have (or aim to have) to ensure consistency across multiple disciplines \u2014 from identity to packaging to digital product to brand communications?\u201d**\n   - Shows strategic/system-level design thinking; indicates you\u2019re thinking about scaling design operations across disciplines.\n\n1. **\u201cFrom a leadership standpoint: what are your biggest pain-points today when delivering brand experiences end-to-end? Where do you feel the Design Director\u2019s involvement can make the biggest difference (speed, consistency, creative quality, efficiency, client satisfaction, etc.)?\u201d**\n   - Allows them to reflect on current limitations \u2014 and shows you\u2019re framing yourself as a problem-solver and value-creator, not just a creative hire.\n2. **\u201cHow do you measure the impact of design work internally (ROI, brand equity, customer experience, business metrics)? What KPIs or success criteria will the Design Director be accountable for?\u201d**\n   - Good to understand expectations and show you\u2019re outcome-oriented.",
  "full_transcript": "Me: Hello.  \nThem: Hello.  \nMe: Sandro. How you doing?  \nThem: I'm good. I'm here.  \nMe: I'm all good. It's good to meet you. Nice room. S.  \nThem: Yeah, it's all right. We have a new office in Oslo-2-04 so.  \nMe: Oh, cool. What? Is this where you are now?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: When did you move it? When did you move in there?  \nThem: September? I think so. It's a couple of months.  \nMe: Oh, epic.  \nThem: Ago. But it's really good.  \nMe: Oh, good. Man. Good. Well, it's good to meet you. I've obviously seen you guys come up a lot, so I'm keen for this chat. I'm excited to kind of dive in. And hear what's what. But how's your weekend? Are you busy? Or is it kind of quieting down or what's going on?  \nThem: Yeah. No, I guess it's a bit. As always here. It's a bit busy. Also, I'm trying to take a week off early this Christmas. So that makes it so I have this weekend next.  \nMe: Yes. Yeah, it means just triple the work.  \nThem: Pet. Yeah.  \nMe: You know, double the pace, I guess.  \nThem: Yes, and then I have to work. I'm sure that week I'm off anyway.  \nMe: Are you going away somewhere?  \nThem: See how it.  \nMe: Nice.  \nThem: Yeah, I'm from up north in Norway, so I'm going to. To, which is like parab.  \nMe: Oh, cool, man. I love that.  \nThem: So that's nice.  \nMe: Yeah, that is nice.  \nThem: And how about you guys?  \nMe: Oh, good. All good. It's like for us, it's always so busy. All the way up until the end, mainly because I think it's kind of like the global presence really makes that a thing. Like it doesn't matter what country we're working, and there's always somewhere that's busy and alive. You know, I feel like when we first. When we first launched in the because we're predominantly. We started in London.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Now we're kind of all over Europe. We're obviously in the States and in the UAE as well. And each one of those markets can be like, If one's quiet, the other one's super busy and vice versa. So you're kind of non stop, you know, and then like internally. We've done quite a lot of repositioning of our products and what we offer. You know, if we were speaking this time nine months ago or even six months ago, unknown was quite a different place to where we are now. And definitely, definitely for the better in terms of how we service clients. So that's. That's been fun. It's been a bit of an education to some because we've kind of moved out of just pure recruitment agency. Like, yes, we obviously do that, but there's so many other parts to how we help a business scale.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: So it's a lot more fun. And I'll tell you that it's. It's a lot more consultative, it's a lot more enjoyable. In terms of how we. How we pitch ourselves, but. But yeah, man, it's busy. It always will be. I feel like.  \nThem: Yeah, but that's great. It's. I guess, curse on the blessing and occurs.  \nMe: Yeah, 100. But I wanted to ask as well. How did you. Had you heard of us before? How did you come across us?  \nThem: No. I guess it's the same as always. It's just like bits and pieces. I actually can't remember. I know also that can't remember who in Abram like. So we're part of Adra Network.  \nMe: Oh, yeah, yeah.  \nThem: So there's like, we're basically 1400 people. In that, like, consulting setting. And then KH is kind of like, we have five verticals. KH is basically the brand of marketing vertical.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: So there's always lots of. There's many. Yeah. We're around 200 globally in KH.  \nMe: Wow.  \nThem: So there's a lot of people and some have knowledge here and some. So it's always. But I. I guess I just thought of you guys in this setting, of us looking a bit internationally, but. I guess. I'm a partner in the ADRAR system too. So technically. Technically, I moved back to Oslo-2-04 five years ago. My friends ran a studio called Heydays.  \nMe: Cool. Yes.  \nThem: And then we made a studio called Goods that was more on packaging and physical design. And then we got bought up by what was.  \nMe: Wow.  \nThem: So now we are a part of KH because we've combined this into one.  \nMe: Wow. So when was that? When did that get acquired?  \nThem: We got acquired, like, three, four years ago.  \nMe: Yeah, yeah.  \nThem: So I'm a lot in Stockholm and yeah, now we're starting up in London. So there's, like, there's lots of opportunities, I think, in general, and. And I know also, like, on. A I'm sure there's lots of opportunities on a global level, too, because it's as you know, it's hard to find the right people in the setting of Be good to hear also about all the stuff you do, so also lots of SS me taking things for granted or just as I'VE seen it so.  \nMe: Y. Eah, sure.  \nThem: Yeah, but that's a bit of the background.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: And so there's always.  \nMe: What's going on?  \nThem: Oh,  \nMe: I then come back. You said  \nThem: Yes. How are you?  \nMe: you literally were like, you know, some some really cool things we could do And then my connection broke, and I was like, oh, this is this is a real really dramatic  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: pause. I like it. Then there was nothing, but but I think I got you. I  \nThem: Listen.  \nMe: feel like there's lots there's lots of areas outside of probably what you think we do. We could be quite valuable to each other as well.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: But but, look, I I'm aware of times. I'm I reckon I could chat with you for three hours, and I've only known you seven minutes. But it'd be good to know I'd love to dive a bit deeper into what's what's currently going on. Like, what's the thing that's that's really energizing? What's the thing that's blocking you from from the next evolution of growth? And I'm sure it'll be something around this  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: design director, creative director style person. And we can kinda talk a little bit more around that and then, like, obviously give you more info on us. Of course.  \nThem: Yeah. Of course. Yeah. That'd be great to know. Yeah. Well, like, technically, if well, as you know, probably from working with with other agencies, we constantly have  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: a need. Things are constantly changing. So this is kind of a I guess it is a type time in the kind of a a place and time and the reason. So we've we've established the Oslo office. We spent one year in in merging three companies into KH. So both kind of  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: building KH and emerging three companies. So we've now done that. We've gone from in Oslo, we've gone from 40 people from three agencies, and now we are around 30.  \nMe: Okay. Well,  \nThem: So we've some people are new to other ADR companies. And some have, I could say, been been some have been these, like, motivated out or or found on a  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: pathways out. So we're kind of sharpening what we are and what we're doing. At the same time, like, competing, like, it we have an extreme growth in incoming requests. Also, I think because of the quality we do, So everything is you can say, what we what trying it or we're working quite a lot now between World Global KH, but because of the technical need here is now for the Oslo office, I don't think there's any, like, limitations. We basically staff people across offices We now have I would guess, like, six full timers in New York,  \nMe: Mhmm.  \nThem: We have around, I think, a few in Chicago, So and Stockholm and Oslo is, a forty minute flight between  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: or a or a train trip. So we do lots of cross starting too. So this is more also, you can say, to kind of to kind of work with the the Norwegian offering, but everything that's in Norwegian offering is a global offering.  \nMe: Yeah. Is that and I guess  \nThem: Too. So that's the  \nMe: that do you mean that as well in in the clients you work with? How's that split up? If there's, a US based client, can it can it sit with the European offices as well?  \nThem: Yeah. We have I think we have all versions. So there's no one that we have project projects where we're like, start at one office and then we need  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: expertise from another one. We do fifty fifty staffing. So we do, like, cross staffing across countries to kind of get collaboration going. We have people moving here for periods and then working on lots of local projects. So we we probably have all of them, but I would guess it's our income is probably around $50.50 of Norwegian I guess, global. I'm guessing maybe 40% Norwegian income and then 60% from outside of Norway.  \nMe: Yeah. I got you. Okay. Because you guys don't have have any people based in The UK or London?  \nThem: Well, we have one guy who's moved back to his family. So Steve but I get I think he actually lives in Kent, but he travels we have an Adra office in London with close to London Bridge? So it's, five or six people.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But they're technically not KH. They're technically humane. That's the developer company. And other companies, but everything we do in a draw is to be quite seamless. And they very often, like, cross staff because we have so many systems on our back side. We have, like, a career development framework. We have different levels. And everything is the same system. So we basically have different fronts. And different brands. So our strategy is obviously to have different brands. We don't want to become a a monk or a big  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: one  \nMe: Of course.  \nThem: we have that as a strategy that's kind of a foundational one. Also because we see that through the KH brand and the above brand, which is our hardware innovation, studio. Also about 200. We get lots of  \nMe: Oh, wow.  \nThem: requests, and people want to work for those brands.  \nMe: That's what I mean. Like, when you're when a big group is acquiring a business, like, it's the they look at I obviously look at a few things. We find ourselves in the m and a world quite often, and  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: it's like the power of the brands of the agents is just, I think, more and more and more important these days. Like,  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: it's what I think it's what debts did really well, to be fair. You know? Like,  \nThem: Right. No.  \nMe: it really felt like those agencies main maintained their own identity, which was nice.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: So, yeah,  \nThem: Yeah. We're way more on the depth part than, the they have the other more consolidated big ones.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. So tell me, with with KH, I feel like it feels like you have a few different specialisms from the outside looking in and different obviously, the different practices. Like, what where's the majority of that revenue coming from in which specialism or is it quite equally balanced? And then the follow-up question is with this hire, are we looking to bring a person into kind of boost another practice or or kind of build the all of them in general, or how does that look?  \nThem: Yeah. Well, I get it's these days, it's like a three parts. We basically started out through what we, like, sometimes just call design. Right? It's a visual  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: visual design. Went into identity visual identities and and branding, obviously, more these days. So it's a complete thing. But on both of those like, if that's the middle and the the legacy we have to the left of that, we have insights and strategy now. So  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: obviously, brand strategy is really important. I think we have around 25 brand strategists. Like like all the the global studios. And then we have also now inside where we're starting out, but that's also a growing part for us. And then on the because on the right side, we've we've added a couple of comms agents also in a drought to that. So we do lots of social media and content production. So we run  \nMe: Oh, cool.  \nThem: for many, like, for many brands, we run their social media accounts like Minecraft. We run their TikTok, or  \nMe: Oh, really?  \nThem: Netflix Nordics, Samsung Nordics. We we run them so both, like, the the crowd engagement part, but also the production, the planning, the growth,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: all that.  \nMe: Is that  \nThem: We kind of  \nMe: is that charged on, like sorry. I have to interrupt. Is that charged on, like, more of a retained base when it comes to running social media accounts? How do you price it?  \nThem: Yeah. Very often, it's a team on a retainer. Yeah.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay.  \nThem: So it's monthly, quarterly, yearly, things. We see, like, we have an extremely high rate of growing them. So very often, it's to to us is more just getting that started and  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: staffing it right. As we do that lots of them, obviously, that means that we can we can work on what starts as kind of a visual rebrand, like international. Let's say it's a truck company. We can we now work 20, 30 people with that after three years too. So we like, through the consultancy, is also a part of Edra, we've kind of we we try to take the best bits from consultancy so that we manage to work more with the client after also just  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: big reveal of a rebrand.  \nMe: Yeah. I remember seeing your, like, international  \nThem: Partner.  \nMe: work. It looked humble. It looks so good.  \nThem: Yeah. That was  \nMe: God, that's  \nThem: was also a big one, so I that's not every day, but  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: it's a gigantic project. Like, normally, we you see, like, a case study film and you see there's lots of stock footage, but there's actually no thing that's stock in that. It's just everything is short.  \nMe: Wow. Really? That's crazy.  \nThem: Planned, and failed, and done, like, everything. It's I think that's, like, 30 people for a year. It's a crazy project.  \nMe: That's crazy. Oh, cool. Okay.  \nThem: So we have I would say we k k h kind of started out in I always been kind of have a have a house style, but we're very much more agnostic these days, and we do very complex brand projects. We did quite simple stuff, and we have a style. This day, we we probably have less of a style, and we do way more diverse and complex brand. Projects, basically. So it's a bit of a it's a bit of a growth for the we've gone from, like, 30 people I would guess four years ago, and now we're 200. So it's a big  \nMe: Wow. That's crazy growth. That's impressive, though. I think, like,  \nThem: yeah.  \nMe: it's it's also really nice to see the it sounds so much again, from I don't know the amount from the outside looking in, you've gone moved away from any sense of, like, time based service or commoditized service to to products and selling parts of, like, in KH selling products, which is really cool, especially in the strategic stuff. You know?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Just a nicer way to get up the ladder, I imagine, and then upsell beyond that.  \nThem: Yeah. Exactly. No. But we see like, we see the value of that, and we have also great people from Adrian helping. We can say, We've converted lots of of consultancy people and management stands now creativity, which is a great way to do. That.  \nMe: Was gonna ask this, like, where and we'll dive into the role a bit deeper in a sec. But, like, where do you feel where do you feel you see people coming from that are most ex successful in cage or get on get on best of all? Is it like a is it a in house creative team within a consultancy? Is it more of like a traditional branding agency doing digital? What what kind of feel is it?  \nThem: What was the question? I understand the last part, but what was the the first question in the  \nMe: I guess what the people who come in in k eight into KH and do really well  \nThem: oh, yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: Yeah. We're what's their traits? So where do they come from?  \nThem: Well, it's like in many cases, I would say, especially for the because if I if I kinda slice that brand, again in the middle up in four parts, it's basically brand, It's digital. We now have physical, which is packaging and  \nMe: Oh, cool.  \nThem: scale and spaces. And then we have, like, special areas like motion and type. So we have a type foundry, and we have motion and three d, which is growing a lot. So I think we're, like, 10 or 12 people there.  \nMe: Oh, great.  \nThem: So it depends on where you come from, basically, but I would say in the brand and digital part are best hires are very often from smaller studios or similar studios. So they come from creative side and very often the agency side.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: We are a I like, there's lots of there's lots of rationality here, but I think KH is best when it's also, like, great taste and like, a bit of an edge to it. We're not like, there's so many agencies out there or consultancies or kind of digital IT companies doing technically the same thing as we, but they're not opinionated and they don't have that creative flare, basically.  \nMe: Yeah. That's so true. I think, like, it's especially in well, where I see most is in those digital agencies. Whether it's digital product or web based or whatever it is, it's like it's been, in the last couple of years, really following processes and then creating quite democratized work, if I'm honest, and, like,  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: the ones who are really good in there are the ones who are frustrated in those places because they're not getting enough  \nThem: Yeah. Exactly.  \nMe: to be honest, enough of a chance to create something a little bit different to what what's, like, essentially a white label product at this point. You know?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And I think that all comes from being able to question a client early on and being confident enough to do that as an agency, if it if that makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And I yeah.  \nThem: Yeah. This is yeah. That's a good point. And I think very often the the also the best projects we get from like, it's crazy these days, but also we get, like, all the big global companies contact us. But it's really often also through craft. So it's like a creative director who's  \nMe: Oh, really?  \nThem: moved from Nike to Google, and then he's like, but I wanna work with these guys. These are my specialists. And that's when we get kind of the that's something we have access  \nMe: That's really interesting.  \nThem: which is other agencies don't have that access. They kinda have to kind of sell more, and kind of work their way. Like, either have a non a tier client and then do a tier work, but we try we're actually in the position of doing both.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And, obviously, that means we have like, I I guess it's kinda two sided. So, financially, we both have projects that are long retainers for big corporate clients, but this higher and kind of the main part of the KH creative team here would definitely be kind of that role that it sits. In a really interesting position of good briefs, good companies. Probably also lots of possibility to change and have a pause in kind of there's yeah. Sometimes there's the different pictures, but it could also be working on two or three global projects at the same time in different kind of  \nMe: That's that's really good to hear. To be honest with you, I think, like, I feel a lot of alignment in what we get asked as well as quite in a similar in a similar vein is, like, where I think we do best is for the businesses that that can access that top 1%, but want want to be able to tell the story externally in a really good way. Like,  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: think where we find our most value is allowing some of the best agencies in on the planet to hit the next stage of growth or transformation with the right people Like, it's you know, like, my my I remember when I worked worked in some big scale ups in the past, like a Spotify and Deliveroo and so on. Hiring, like, product product design teams and brand teams and honestly, I think my biggest problem with trying to find the best people to come in spot was that I had Spotify strapped to my forehead when I approached them,  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: because, like, yes, Spotify is a good brand externally, but some of the best in the industry have already made judgments of what that place might be like.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Until you get on call with them and you realize, oh, shit. There's so much cool stuff happening behind the scenes. I think, like, that's what we found a lot of value in what we can do is, like, we can we can proactively hedge fund anyone we want. We can create that list together. And to be honest with you, I I feel extremely confident that we can  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: we can get people in the room and start to talk about what KH is doing and what actually makes you so special. Compared to your competitors. So I what I would wanna do and if know, as as we kind of partner up with each other is, yes, find you the best talent on the planet. But be able to tell the story of KH in the right way.  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: And I think that's important because, really, what we've gotta remember is you know, there are, like, there are around 20 people unknown each person having five conversations a day with anyone from a senior designer to a CCO and up.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I think, like, that times 20 per week per month per year is a lot of conversations that we could be having. So we wanna make sure  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Life situations and timings and everything. Right? So it's  \nMe: yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A 100%. So I think, like, it's really important that we that you feel that you're being represented by us in the right way. And that's why I'm really keen to know, I I know we've run out of time on this one, but it'll be really good to do a follow-up session again and be like, bring on the right people who are gonna help from unknown who are gonna help hire your your teams and make sure that they're have a really good understanding of of yes, where you guys are at now, but where you're trying to get to. And that's that will help us able to tell that story. So, yeah, that that's a bit of thought there. But I I also I'm aware. I wanted to quickly I know we're running out, but with this with the d d c d s t, it was kind of like  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: a few different titles in one. I mean, where where do you think you're landing on with that?  \nThem: Yeah. Well, for the for the role like, we're all I think the most important us is kind of the match.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: It's not like we're not the gigantic system, and we're just trying to a certain piece. It's quite a quite of an open moment. It could be a person that just really has the energy, has got the opportunity to do anything in the kind of the right place before. It could be a person that done it before. Right? Or  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I'm thinking also, like, we we don't speak too much about that but, like, living in the Nordics, is a really different thing than living other places. And I think lifestyle wise, it's it's another planet.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: From we were quite, laden. There's overtime, and we do like, big sessions before pitches and stuff. But it's way more balanced than I ever experienced in London or in America. So it's, I think that's one of the parts also here is that, like, geographically, it's a really interesting move for many people.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And I'm sure there's, like, the the I guess, the perfect candidate, like, obviously, I can say something about the, like, kind of the the more specific role, I think also the situation for the person or the the person's is that it's this is kind of a a step down tempo wise, but not ambition wise.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So we you hopefully could like, I think this is one of the few companies in in The Nordics that you can keep kind of almost like a pulse that feels global and breathing and impactful. So that's hopefully a good thing. And then  \nMe: Definitely.  \nThem: for the role, I think it's like we speak a lot about like, it it's not a we have lots of UX and UI in KH, and we will always have that. But we're really, really driven more by people who make experiences that are, like, digitally native. If it's a person that's like, I I do digital, you guys do brand, that's not the right person because we want something that, like,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: naturally thinks. Digital. That's in Norway, the kind of the the East. It's very hard to find those people because very often, you you found an in house job and you become a part of that. And there's not too many places that offer kind of that ability for digital to define brands in a way. So it's kind of a both ways. We won't we do, like, a really interesting creative process. I can tell you that later, but we just merge motion and type and, physical and digital together. Right? We  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: brands. And experiences, and we were not too limited by clients asking for this and that. It's we we really wanna create things from that haven't been done before.  \nMe: Definitely.  \nThem: That's why I think that person really is like, we we have people in the similar roles in Stockholm and New York, so, like, it can come probably lean on them. But they never think I'm gonna I'm gonna work digitally now.  \nMe: Yeah. It's it's  \nThem: It's it's not it's it's  \nMe: what totally. It's not like what you're selling is a menu of things. Right? It's not someone can come and say, I want this digital part, this this motion part, blah blah blah. It's it's about translating a brand and and and transforming a brand a creative way.  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: Through, yes, there'll be elements of brand, digital, physical, motion, and time. Right?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And someone who can who can communicate in all of those worlds is really important. They might be a specialist in one or two of them, but able to flex across all or or communicate with teams do is really important, I imagine.  \nThem: Yeah. Exactly. So that, like just to kind of finish up that I think it's, like, that person could come from, like, the could be a person that's done lots of web experiences. It could be a person that's done lots of products or app experiences, but it could also be a brand person that just leads. Naturally towards digital. So they think in interactions, so they think in in in patterns or in motion, like, it's it's quite open in that sense.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's great. I I mean, that's our favorite. Type of brief. And and would they be would they have to be based in a particular city? Or  \nThem: Yeah. So for this one, I think it's an Oslo, hire, also because we want that person to impact  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: the culture and the people, obviously, that because that narrows a lot.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Down. But that's the plan for this role is that it's role that kind of becomes a part of the the furniture and the the the culture here. But, obviously, we work, like, there's lots of travel and people move all the time. We have we have we've put people at different offices, so depending on the wish of them. Person. Some people just prefer to stay in one city and never But some really prefer to go to  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: to New York or California whenever we have projects in stay there. So that's really open.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay. That's great. And then when it comes to I guess this is a little bit more new on like, a bit more in the nitty gritty that we can cover at the time, but how how is that team set up, and how does this person fit? I imagine it's a quite a flat structure  \nThem: Yeah. Well, it's yeah. It's  \nMe: in well, like like most Nordic companies, but  \nThem: yeah. I think, well, since we have the level systems, it's quite easy. We we would call this a level four or level five or level six.  \nMe: Okay. Cool.  \nThem: A a principal, like a chief creative officer level one is an intern. I'm a level five, so that's a creative director level, and then we have on level four is a design director or, like, a  \nMe: Got you.  \nThem: design or digital design director. I'm guessing that four is the sweet spot, but because let's let's say it's flexible down to, like, four and a half, which is close to a creative director, and then three and a half, which is a very senior  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: expert designer or we call them senior designers, basically.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay. Cool. And then when it comes to urgency and start, first of I'm I'm I'm obviously picturing this person as a full time hire. Do you think is is there a  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: is there a freelance need in the short term, or is there, like, a a not a gap to fill, but is there work there that needs more support, or  \nThem: No. I think, actually, we're  \nMe: how does that look?  \nThem: thinking more, like, the kind of the team structure and that person to be the right one to kinda set the agenda also and be part of the next  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: growth of it. So we do have backups And then, obviously, we use our different offices to to but I think also in like, if if if this all goes well, I'm sure, like, we're really really interested in kind of finding great people at different situations. So some could be short term, some are long term, some are  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: in the future, or someone is like, here's a new business unit. So there's different versions of that. But for now, I think it's a rather wait for the right person than  \nMe: Yeah. Definitely. And to be honest with you, like, that's where I think the the longer this this of partnership and relationship goes on for, the more we can flex into different parts of unknown. Right? Because really, what I imagine this to be is when it's when it's one, two, or three kinda hires at a time, we usually do our  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: iconic sort of search product, which is your kind of very standard hiring individuals. Right?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And then second product is called the bench, which is more of like a very flexible curated freelance bench. So what we can do is build you sprint and build you benches that are completely vetted top quality who are very interested in working with KH in some capacity. And what we can do is have a  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: an account manager to help manage that availability. So we always know that when you look on that  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: sheet or that part of our website, this is curated to you and they'll always be available.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: So that's quite interesting. And then the final one is more around really long partnerships where you're looking to really scale anything from let's say, two hires a month for six months or, like, you have  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: generally a six to six plus hires is when that could be quite good.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And it's usually more cost effective because we would do, like, a monthly flat fee that we can then work work off of. So there are a few different ways we can work together. Where I imagine  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: this landing is in that first product that that I told you about.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: But what I can do is I can send you a little bit more about how that looks in practice for this. In in an email and what that looks like, and we can obviously jump on another call and  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: talk about it in more depth. But to to be honest with you, I think, like, like, I this is my favorite type of search. I I love businesses like Kage that are trying to increase the quality even more from already a high quality. And what I'd love to do is is work as closely with you on who I think like, where we can look for, where we can look from, And and look like it we we'd be we'd be ready to go as quickly as you can just because of our timing. We're actually we're in quite a good time now where we have a few searches coming to an end. In a in a positive way. So we're actually opening up a little bit more. Because because when it when it comes to when you'd wanna get started on this, is it kind of like this week, next week, or new year? How what do you kinda see?  \nThem: Well, there's nothing stopping us. So ready also to kinda do do things that's needed. Depends on, like, how much we or you are say, So it's or how much you can manage to kind of do before  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: and also how long your your like, normally this takes for you and all of that. And, like, for all I know, we're an impossible case, and it's hard or so it's more, but I would say there's nothing hindering us too much, and I don't think it's gonna be, like, I don't think, like, it's, like, a complex for us to be involved in. Hopefully, it's a kind of it takes efforts, but something we could also be involved in before Christmas, hopefully.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. And, like, we can work with that. And I think, like, what what I'm happy to do is recommend because because if you work with many external sort of talent agencies or recruitment agencies,  \nThem: We haven't. Well, we were just speaking to a Norwegian one. The a very different type of of local creative  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I would say. So we haven't in this sense. Now it's  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: normally, we we've done this in a consider an ad hoc setting with our own networks very often. And then we post roles externally and then normally our standard method of doing it.  \nMe: Yeah. And I again, I think this could be really great to I wanted to know like, if there's one thing that or that you've struggled with hiring talent before, like, what's one thing you would change? Like, what's also one thing that you'd love more of when it comes to talent? Is it like very different perspective? Is it kind of the the next idea of of of innovation when it comes to digital experience and and design? Or what does that kinda look like to you?  \nThem: Yeah. Well, I guess, if it's like for the role, obviously, it's it's being that kind of salt leader in both in the local office, but also play a part  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: in the global agenda. In general, for the, like, the personalities and kind of good hot like, as I mentioned, I think that mix of not being one like, we really were a system where it's really easy to get responsibility.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: We are really often, there's not very, very little that hinders any individual to take on or get a position. It's really not a kind of a sharp elbows either. Normally, in Scandinavia, also, are quite happy to just do their job, but I think this is kind of a thing that's been, like, I I see this role as sometimes also doing things that doesn't like, it's not a the given task, but you kind of you're given a general responsibility of the  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: development of the the offering. So like, I'm guessing these are words you get for all of the things, but, like, ambitions, self propelled, curious, like, it's it's those things that not only for the craft, not only for kind of the CV, but, also personality traits, obviously, which is important.  \nMe: Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. I think, like, the thought lead is interesting because you can get you can get, like, two types Right? Like, someone who's got a very good thought leadership also very big ego, if I'm honest.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Others who who can who can be quite, like just like  \nThem: No.  \nMe: yes, a thought leader and very intelligent with that, but also super collaborative in a in a  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: bigger org or bigger to creative team and know how to get the best out of each other. And I think, like, to to be honest with you, like, both can be really valuable to different types  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: of businesses, but I think that second one for KH, what the feeling is, like, that's the one that type of person that could could add a lot of value here.  \nThem: Yeah. I think I think may maybe I might just from the little experience I have in I think it's like I I think that person might be surprised by the amount of space  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: like or runway ahead of that person. Right? I think that normally isn't that natural everywhere. It's there are systems to keep things in place, but here it's it's not like that. I think we're quite good on with and kind of depth, but we are also sometimes lacking personalities that want to take a step. And that's really not kind of not responsibility, but have opinion and kinda drive to make that a reality.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. 100%. I hear you. No. I'm I'm excited about this. I think, like, we could uncover some really, really interesting people. And I guess, like, next steps and what we can do is I will I've already got some kind of names and ideas running through my head, but I'll save those for now. I just wanna I'll share how we work and what it would look like. I'll outline  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: that main first product that I talked about and then maybe those second two just for the future.  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: And then let me know if there's any other conversations I need to have If we need to do another follow-up as well, I'm more than happy to.  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: Just to give you a bit of an idea, and then look. We'd we'd be ready to hit go as soon as you guys are. Just just give us a shout. Yeah.  \nThem: Great. No. But that's super so you'll send some I'm guessing you send that. But how do you normally would you do, a success fee, or do you do, like, a base search fee? Or how would the chart for the  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Sure. So, typically, we would we would charge our our normal standard fee, and that's that's 22%. And what we would do is charge 30% of that fee up front as a deposit. What that does is allow us to put KH at the top of the list and of of our priorities, but also, like, it means that I can pull in more resource from unknown. So what we're doing is leveraging not just one network, but we could leverage 10 networks. And what's good about that is because yes, brands, digital, physical, motion, and type, they they all have a lot of crossover with each other with with each other. But, actually, discovering and uncovering specialists within that when it comes to talent could be in all different networks. So  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: that allows us to pull in a a wider network and shortlist that down But when it comes to that upfront fee, it it actually it's no different in terms of the total fee in any other way of work. It just will come off the final fee at the end. So yeah. And and, also, let's say,  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: because, you know, some pushback will be oh, like, what if this this tile isn't successful? Successful, which I I very much doubt, but we've got to spare in mind that it could happen. That deposit could then get get  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: drawn down from another role in the future if we needed to. But to be honest with you, I think, like, I'm really I wouldn't be taking this call if I didn't think that we feel really confident we can fill it. Especially if we're leveraging more of unknown's time. So that's kinda how it works, but I'll outline it in an email. It can be a little bit easier to  \nThem: Yeah. That's super. Oh, but it's great to know.  \nMe: Oh, Sandra, what I might need is just like an idea of have you got an idea of budget or package or what that might look like for for this?  \nThem: We haven't, but I'll I can have a look at kinda what we like, there's a range.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure.  \nThem: Somewhere. So look it up with some of the and the  \nMe: Yeah. That's totally cool. And, look, like, if it's  \nThem: I'll I'll answer to your mail on that.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do that. That sounds good.  \nThem: Part.  \nMe: Cool. Right. I apparently need to be Someone just texted me saying, are you coming? And I was like, I don't know. Anyway, look. It's so good to meet you, mate, and and we'll be in touch really soon.  \nThem: Alright. Yeah. You too.  \nMe: I'll send I'll send over a note in the next kinda hour or so.  \nThem: Perfect. Thank you, Sean.  \nMe: Amazing. Alright. Catch you later. Bye bye.  \nThem: Yeah. Bye."
