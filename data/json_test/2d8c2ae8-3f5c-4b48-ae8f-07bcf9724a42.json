  "full_transcript": "Them: Then I'll be right with you. Sorry.  \nMe: No stress at all. Sorry for being so late.  \nThem: No worries. Sorry. How you doing?  \nMe: Hey. I'm good. How have you been?  \nThem: Good. Busy. All good things. We've just shot super bowl out in LA for fanatics, which is great.  \nMe: Well.  \nThem: We've got another shoot next week for Cash app and another one for Champion. So yeah. Stuff is happening. Kush started, which is great.  \nMe: Do you feel like? I know we're not there with the strata high, but do you feel like less stress now that someone can take the creative.  \nThem: Yeah. Having Kush has been amazing. Also, Aaron, who I hired from Adam and Eve, like, having her in has just taken a ton of my plate.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Like, it's been so nice. I mean, it's still agonizingly busy, but, like, feels just for a number of reasons, like, it just feels like there's good momentum.  \nMe: Good.  \nThem: Like good people coming in, good work, going out, so. Yeah. Just need more now, you know?  \nMe: One, of course.  \nThem: The next wave of hires. I've also. I've got an offer out to my. To an EA for me. So that will be like another plate instead of me constantly being like, I didn't add a zoom link to this meeting.  \nMe: Good. Okay. That's so good. Okay, that's glanda here. It's also like, it's nice to approach the end of the air and be like, you can sort of see what the vision is going to look like for next year and not be it not feel so like a last minute scramble. Even though I'M sure it's still mega stressful.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. No, it's. And it's also nice that, like. I don't know. Feel like Aaron and Kush have been the right hires. Obviously, it's still, you know, we cushions earlier days. Obviously. I know errand very well.  \nMe: Yes. Yes.  \nThem: But. But yeah.  \nMe: It's.  \nThem: I'm excited for when the next, like, two, three people come in, I can just see how, like, how that's going to work and how much that's going to, like, transform the business, so.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: All good things, but how's everything from your side?  \nMe: Good. Good. Just absolutely mental. Like, oh, I feel like last week I was off. Last week I was in Madrid, which was lovely, but, like, wrong time to take holiday. I just had so many days to use. And I knew that I really wanted to buckle down, like, now into December. So, yeah, I took. Took a few days, went to the J, which was great. But, like, you know, when you're trying to do that half working, half knot, things need.  \nThem: Yeah, it's the worst.  \nMe: It just doesn't work. And, yeah, we've got a lot of very, like, big searches which are just quite consuming but, like, really positive and really exciting. Just a lot. A lot. Yeah. The next few weeks is just a bit chaotic, but all good.  \nThem: Yeah. And then it. And then it's like before, you know, it's Christmas, you know, and then it's 20, 26, and I just don't know how we've got that.  \nMe: I know. And it's even. Even with this. Kind of market mapping again, so. Yeah, it was awful. It last week, the week before, I just did like a bunch of messages, I feel, out of that sheet. I don't know if you've got the link. It's the same. It's the same. I did a different tab.  \nThem: Yeah. Let me have a look. I haven't looked in a while, to be honest, but.  \nMe: Strategy 2.0.  \nThem: Oh, yeah.  \nMe: And. Yeah. Just, honestly, trying to get cool to people is already starting to become quite problematic. And I know that you guys. Is it Thanksgiving today? No, tomorrow.  \nThem: Thursday, Thursday, Friday. Most people.  \nMe: So do people take holiday like this week? Typically.  \nThem: Yeah, it's. It gets a little, like. It gets a little slow this week, for sure.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah, because I had initial conversations with some Qatar and someone called David. David, we had a follow up call, was booked in for this week. He's now moved that to next week and then Tara. We've got a follow up called next week because she had this whole week off and then she has her, like, Alto trip to Canada and then everyone starts to do that, like work parties, and it's a bit stressful.  \nThem: Yeah, I know.  \nMe: But.  \nThem: And just people just aren't in the, like, mindset of, like, taking a new thing in December, I think.  \nMe: This is it. And I think I had such good momentum, and I think naturally, when things were progressing with Baru, you do just. You don't. You just don't do loads of average because you feel like you have an okay short list. So just coming back from the beginning, just being, like, really transparent, I found. That it's been less people have been. That's receptive, I think, just in culture of where they're at towards the end of the year. Having said that, though, I've got a bunch of call this week.  \nThem: Yeah. Yes.  \nMe: And I'm just in, like, proper outreach mode again. And I'm just kind of framed a bit more casually and making it a bit more like, you know, let's just have a conversation rather than it be centered around this particular hire. Why they're perfect for this hire, tapping into their frustrations of where they might be. It's more like coming to the end of the year, talking about next year. Let's jump on a call as I think that approach is working a lot better rather than it being presented around the brief. But having said that, where it's a bit more of a casual approach, people are a bit more casual when they're booking calls, but it's fine. I've got some go calls. One directly after this with Taylor. I've got three tomorrow, so I'm hoping if I can get some times from you just like what your diary is looking like. Where? Yeah, what kind of time zone? You're going to be in.  \nThem: Y. Es. Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I. I basically out Thursday, Friday, Monday, because I'm in the uk.  \nMe: In.  \nThem: Like we're traveling for Thanksgiving. And then I come back on Monday. I'm in New York. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday I fly to la. Friday.  \nMe: In.  \nThem: And I'm back in new york Monday. And then I'm back in la the following Friday.  \nMe: Let's try getting some. Maybe Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, next week. Are you cool for me to.  \nThem: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I do Wednesday between 9 and 10 my time or 11 my time.  \nMe: Okay? Cool. I definitely, I think Tara's definitely one I want to get you a conversation with, as is David. And I'm hoping to get a couple more from just a slightly different, slight different backgrounds. But having said that, aligned to kind of the work that you're doing at the minute and maybe the conversations that you're having with Erin and Coach and stuff like, is there something you're wanting to see more of or less of or, like, is there a space? Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah. Y. Eah. I think with like. And let's, let's make sure we talk about Banner as well and where we're going to, like, where we want to go with that. Because in my mind, I'm, like, almost saving that lead role for her.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Good degree. And let's be unless we find someone that can really better better her. But I think her superpower is, like, brand and business strategy more so than, like, specific campaign or. Com stuff, which I know she could probably as well. So I. And I think where we need help, like, immediately. Is in the campaign and comms.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Thinking. So, like, more of a comm strategy background, I think. Is. And I know we spoke about that before, but, you know, if I had to pick someone right now, I'd be like, I kind of a Comm. Strat director or that. That type level.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: Is probably what we need in terms of being most effective right now.  \nMe: Yes. Okay, cool. Pretty helpful.  \nThem: Because we've got, like, We've got clients that need it, you know?  \nMe: Yeah. Okay, cool. Because I kind of. Yeah. In my head, I'm sort of splitting it into two. I'm sort of having this kind of, like, if Barney doesn't work out ahead of strategy, like, seriously impressive, like, unreal person. And then more of a kind of, like, back to the beginning brief. Sort of thing.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And I got some calls this week, actually, with more like comms. Like, Taylor was a. She was comstrat at Droga, and then she was at Virtue, and I think she did a brand one after that. So let me maybe have those slightly more junior conversations this week. And how are you? How are you feeling?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: What's the Barney? Because I spoke to her.  \nThem: Yeah. I was meant to call her, and I didn't because I ran out of time. And I just. I haven't had a chance to get back to her. But. Yeah, I don't know if you've spoken to her at all, but I. I think I spoke to Cush about this. Like, we'd love to try and meet her for lunch. Or, like, even if just Cush me. Each for lunch or a coffee or a drink or something. Probably less of a drink, but like, you know, like a coffee or something.  \nMe: No. Yeah.  \nThem: I'd like to try and do that before the end of the year, just. Just to make sure he's, you know, they. They connect and feel good mutually as well, because obviously it's going to be the three of us.  \nMe: Y. Es.  \nThem: But obviously knowing her timings as well. That's why I haven't been, like, pushing it, because it doesn't necessarily feel urgent, but I don't know how she's feeling and, like.  \nMe: Y. Es. Y. Es. I think, interestingly enough, I think from. I think she's got the, like. Got, like, the flavor now, you know what I mean? So she actually was chasing me a bit last week, and I just kind of said I hadn't had a chance to regroup. I was very open insofar as, like, you. Know, obviously there is a. There is an urgent need here. And whether, like, we tailor what that urgent requirement is, that's kind of a conversation myself with James are happening. In the meantime, I know that he's super keen to continue conversations. Just what the pace of that looks like is obviously kind of dictated by. By you both.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: And she was a bit like, you know, would there be a world where I could draw in as a con, like, on a contract sooner? Would there be a world I'm sort of talking about? And I always were like, I don't know. I don't know. Like, I don't. I don't know.  \nThem: What's her deal then? Cuz like, is it like she want it out with maximum effort? A bit more than I had left. I had thought like that's quite a big. That's quite a big leap to make for a pregnant person, you know.  \nMe: I think potentially. But I think it's. I think it's more about. She doesn't want to miss out on this.  \nThem: Right, okay.  \nMe: And I think it's more like, you know, what. What could we design to make this work? Because I don't want to miss out on this opportunity. Kind of give.  \nThem: Amazing. Like, I. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to miss out on this opportunity with her, you know, like, so I think. The tough thing for me is. There's six of us here, right? And so every person counts. And I don't know how I survive bringing someone like that in on what will be a considerable salary and then having that person out for at least six months, if not longer. You know, like, that's the bit that I'm struggling with. Like, I think if we were a bigger. If we were bigger team or we were more established, Like, I get it, but, like, I just don't know how I make that work. Like, logistically, business wise, financially for us, like, it's a really, it's a really difficult spot for us to all, you know, I think all of us to be it.  \nMe: Take the general morale and vibe that comes with all being a part of something on the same, like, package it to some extent. You know, it's that kind of like, we're all in this. We can all, like, look at the next two years and be like, whittle systems, go. And I guess also like, to some extent, I would probably, if it was me, I would probably be a bit like, oh, you know, why have they bought this person in? And then they're going away, like, is that person favored? Or. You know what I mean? It just becomes a like.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm also, just, like, in the back of my head, managing Michael and Scott. Like, actually, Michael's just had a baby, so I think that will. That always helps to get people to see. But, like, for example, my ea. I want her to start. I wanted to start next week. She can't start the week after. And Scott, who's our cao coo, is like, why didn't. She just start in the new year? Because otherwise she's starting and we're paying her for two weeks vacation. And I'm a bit like, stop being a penny pincher.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But, like, that's. That's, like, his mindset.  \nMe: Somebody's situation.  \nThem: Totally. Right? And there's a little bit of. There's a little bit of me as well, which is like, managing those two. And I'm still new, right? Like, I'm still, you know, I'm. I'm being given rope here to build something, but I also have to substantiate. My decisions and knowing the type of characters they are. Yeah, like, it's. It's just.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess also what we can do is we can just help build a case in some respects. Like, if we get maybe like a short list of three more like, evidently, junior strategy directors they might see because they've met her, right? Scott and.  \nThem: No.  \nMe: Have they not?  \nThem: They met barney.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You mean? No. No, she's only met Elias, who's like. He's in like the strategy and growth. Team on in la.  \nMe: Okay, okay. Okay?  \nThem: So I think. I don't. I don't have. I know they'll like her, and I don't like.  \nMe: Would you?  \nThem: Everyone I've recommended and bought in so far, everyone's loved. So I think, like, I built up a good. Reputation of, like, identifying the right talent. I think. You know, I'm not sure Sam told you. Like, it was a push to get Kush over the line financially with them because they're not used to paying these, like, slightly weightier ad New York salary salaries. And so, you know, that's the other thing that I think. What? I try to put, like, a bright spin on the situation with Barnu where I'm like, I'm. I would love her to join. But actually like bringing someone on a slightly lower salary and building up like the case for that discipline. Through having that, you know, slightly more palatable salary, perhaps. Maybe a good thing for us, you know?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But. But at the same time, look, I think she's a one in a one in a million talent.  \nMe: Yeah, as do I.  \nThem: And would like to make something happen. It's just I. I think it'll be tough.  \nMe: Yeah. Defer. And I think, like. She is definitely a level above. Well, she isn't in terms of her experience, but also just like her guy and her energy and her sort of professionalism and intelligence. She is definitely a bit of a, like, gap between the people I'm speaking to at the minute. Just to manage your expectations, I don't think we're going to find someone as perfect as her. But we. We are where we are. So let me have these conversations this week. That's helpful to hear that it's more that's not try and find another bar new and that's actually just maybe look a level below just really strong kind of comms strategies.  \nThem: Yeah. I won't say no to meeting someone. If you see them and you think they're right.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But. Like. Why do I want to do is just, like, bring in, like, a head of strategy from an agency, you know, like.  \nMe: Yes. Yeah.  \nThem: I don't think that's the right. Fit.  \nMe: No.  \nThem: Or the right like story.  \nMe: But in terms of what you need them to do in the. In the interim, unless it's someone like Barney, there's almost kind of no need, really, in terms of trying to get that salary over the line. You know what I mean? Like. But. Okay? Cool. Well, yeah, have. Have a little flick through the.  \nThem: Yeah, I'll have a. I'll have a look through. I think there's some. There's some interesting, interesting people in there. And then. Shall I just send you. Well, I used to send you, like, that kind of Google list of availability, and then you can just slot them in.  \nMe: Perfect. Perfect. And I think a lot of these people, like, their notices will be shorter. They're a bit more, like, active and available. So, like, I'm pretty confident we can get some conversations Wednesday next week, Tuesday next week. And then we'll see where we go from there. I guess the narrative to Barney will just be like, you'll be in touch about next steps, but given this, you know, kind of given where we are,  \nThem: Y. Es.  \nMe: This might be a conversation which will evolve. Next year.  \nThem: And I'm going to say to what I've said to you, like.  \nMe: Yeah, of course.  \nThem: We feel good. I want her to meet Kush.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: As an ex step. If we're all feeling good. Like, let's have an open conversation about what great looks like on both sides and seeing. Seeing what that means. For me, I think it means probably, like, bringing in someone that's more like a working level, and then looking to bring Baru in. As and when she wants to post pregnancy, post maternity.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Cool.  \nThem: But, you know, if she goes, look. I'm ready to go now. And actually, I've got another offer. Then that changes things, you know?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Potentially. Although I. It. I don't know if it actually changes things for my.  \nMe: Yeah, I think it's. I think, yeah. She has definitely become a lot more like she's been chasing me, and she's been a lot more curious, and I think she's been a lot more open and flexible. You know, when I first had a conversation with her, it was like, I want this salary. This is that. Blah, blah, blah. I think she's had the buy in and she's really, really excited and she's aware that this is quite a unique opportunity that she really wants herself. But, you know, she's very realistic in, in the situation. I think she's a lot more prepared to make this work than she was before.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Maybe it's put. Yeah, we can go.  \nThem: Love that. Yeah, and it's good. It's also good to hear because, you know, I think that has generally been the case. Like, and particularly the people that I've sparked with and I think get it, are the ones that see the opportunity and want to make it happen. Like, you know, like Kush, like, we managed to make it work out. And I think it's because, again, he was excited by the potential here. And just as you're meeting other people, I think, yeah, it's good. It's good for us to both know that, like.  \nMe: Forward.  \nThem: It. Obviously, I believe in it, but the fact that I think these other great people, like Barnu, like Kush. Are buying into like Aaren are buying into it. I think, demonstrates that, like, the opportunity.  \nMe: It's.  \nThem: Here.  \nMe: Totally. And it's. It's also like you're finding the right people. It's like, this isn't right for somebody that wants to take a sidewind step and, you know, be in. It is going to be challenging. And it's people that want to demonstrate their worth and demonstrate their value at a place like this because they believe in this vision is what we want. That appetite, you know?  \nThem: Great.  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: All right. I'll have a look at this list, but keep on. I mean, I think, like, quick first look, like these feel like the right places. Obviously, I'll look at their specific experience and I'll. I'll add some notes in. But I wouldn't be adverse to meeting any and all of these people. Obviously, within reason, like in the amount of time we have in the next however many weeks, but. But, yeah.  \nMe: Yeah. Cool. Okay. Amazing. And just quickly on. Yeah. One last question on salary. For more like a common strategy director. I think we were looking at, like, 180 beforehand.  \nThem: Yeah, like, I think 180 to, like, 220 on the high side.  \nMe: Okay, cool.  \nThem: But ideally somewhere mid to low of that, you know.  \nMe: Okay, cool. Sounds good. I'll just keep building. I'll keep. Once I've had, like, proper, they're ready to interview. I'll put all of the notes in the system so you can the sheets so you can have them ready for the chat, but I'll just keep you post.  \nThem: Right. All right, sounds good.  \nMe: Thanks, james.  \nThem: Love it. Thanks, Ellie. Appreciate you. Have a good one. Bye."
