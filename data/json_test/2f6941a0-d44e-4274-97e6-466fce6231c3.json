  "full_transcript": "Them: Hi there.  \nMe: Jessica, how are you?  \nThem: I'm good. How are you doing?  \nMe: I'm very well. It's lovely to meet you. I feel like I've been on many, many email chains with you and never spoken to you.  \nThem: Yeah, exactly. That's why I wanted to reach out. I was like, we should have chat. How have you been?  \nMe: I'm very good, thanks. Yeah. Very good. Yeah. Looking forward to the Christmas break. A night you guys who are kind of gearing up for Thanksgiving. So have you got a bit.  \nThem: Yes. Hobbling into it. I think, like 50% of us have some form of cold or something, you know what I mean?  \nMe: Oh, no. Yeah. It's always the case with I won. A public holiday comes up, I swear. And it's like, you know, you've got a bit of a break coming up. Your body just goes, okay, this is the ram. You're, like, running on adrenaline.  \nThem: Sad. Yeah.  \nMe: But, yeah, it's been a hell of a year, as I know it has for you guys as well. It's just been like hamster on a wheel kind of not stopping type of thing.  \nThem: Absolute. Ly. What's been going on with Unknown. Besides, I mean, I guess. Tell me a little bit. Because you came to the US.  \nMe: Probably. A little.  \nThem: Sort of gradually, or was it really like, over the last year it's picked up? How was that experience?  \nMe: Gradually. Or. No. How long have you been amplifying our dress?  \nThem: So I've been here since 2023. February 2023. So it'll be three years this spring. Yeah.  \nMe: Okay? February 2020. Three, okay? Three years. Wow. Okay. Yeah. I mean, we. Look, the long stories. Amplify our OG client. Like, we've been a partner with Amplify for so many years. And when Jevon started to build the US Team and Mark was. And Bonnie and everyone were in the LA team, we started to support them. It would probably about a year before you joined.  \nThem: Y. Es. Right.  \nMe: And the whole idea was like, okay, well, Amplify just one example of. Great agencies that we have a good relationship with wanting to set up in another country. I think historically, even before the pandemic, we had done it for Amplify Australia and maybe bits of Paris, but definitely Australia. And then once we landed in the us, we were like, actually the brand's landing quite well, maybe. We can start our own kind of unknown, the US and the idea was that a couple of us were going to move to the US and set up an office, which is still our ambition, but kind of Trump kind of got in the way of making that happen, and we were making it work remotely, kind of coming out every six weeks to eight weeks. Meeting talent meeting partners, et cetera, et cetera.  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: I was doing the maths this year and it's genuinely 5050 split between Europe and global and the US. For me personally, I do the creative team stuff. So that's all the creative directors and whatnot. However, Woody does all of the design stuff, which is like the architects and the 2D designers, spatial designers, all of that jazz.  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: But we've had a mad year for, in terms of kind of developing what you would call product. So it used to be okay. We do a retained search. Okay. We do a contingency search. Maybe we look after some freelancers. And it was a little bit kind of all over the place. And I guess I was hoping to, at some point, chat to you about 2,026 as well. So your message was genuinely perfectly timed.  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: Because it is developing and it is changing. Talent is at the heart of what we do. Don't get me wrong. But as you can imagine, six years ago we were purely recruitment. And now as our kind of, as our closest partners, some of which are founders, their needs change. Some of them need to restructure, some of them want to sell their business, some of them actually want to acquire other businesses. And as the brand of Unknown has grown. We just have our fingers in lots of different pies and lots of insights into different areas. So I'm working on, like, a couple of M and A projects, which I'd never thought would ever be the case because we know lots of founders of agencies, and then I'm working on ECD searches. And CCO searches around the world. So naturally, our products are just developed. Now, what I can say.  \nThem: Y. Es. Right. Yes. Y.  \nMe: And I'll get to the final point in a second. But the team's grown. We've got 15 people now. We do cover freelance, which is something that we'll talk about. We cover product design, strategy, account handling.  \nThem: Es.  \nMe: And my kind of remit creative as well. So reassentially mirror what an agency does. The only thing we don't really do is production. Frankly, that's the only thing we've not really dipped our toe into yet. Might be something for 2026. So the main changes are what we're calling a bench model, which we'll get onto shortly as essentially our curated freelance bench of talent that we hope is quite revolutionary for paying kind of mad overheads. Then search and consultancy as well, which is typically like, oh, you need an ecd, let's run a search and make it happen. Absolutely gutted. About mct, what happened there. I had a really honest conversation with Jevon as well, so I'm fully aware of what that was going on anyway.  \nThem: Yes. Right.  \nMe: There's a lot going on, Jess, I must admit. But I would love to hear what's going on as well. And kind of like before I go deeper into all of those kind of products and things that I'm saying, How's your year been? Two things I really want to get out of this is like how we can even increase more value for you, make your life easier. And what, you really want to get out of a partnership for next year, too. So. Yeah. How has it been, in your opinion? What are the struggles? Let's go.  \nThem: Yes. Y. Ep. I mean, we've had a. Honestly, we've had a phenomenal year. It's not without its challenges, I think, for any new business having a phenomenal year. And for us, as the US entity sort of operating and growing in this market, it does feel like we're in, like, startup mode. It doesn't have been some time.  \nMe: Honestly. We've had a phenomenal. Business. Having abnormal. Year. And for. Usmc. Growing. In. Market. It does feel like. We're in. Yeah.  \nThem: And so if you have a phenomenal year, it's almost like, first you're super excited, and it is a bit of pinch me, and then you're kind of like, how am I gonna keep this moving and keep the train on the tracks?  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: So for us, that's meant a phenomenon. Means a lot of business, right?  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: We've obviously transitioned some of the global clients to US Clients, which is wonderful. Retain the business that we had the year before. I think, like, prior to that, when Market Bonnie were first coming out. They didn't really have a team yet, so it was difficult to sort of one deliver on really excellent client satisfaction and to transition that into like, long term clients. But over the past two years, we've been able to do that where we really overperformed in our projects, and as a result,  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: We're able to continue those key clients. So there's a couple like Coinbase, Yahoo to be the streaming platform.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Where we're doing a large number of projects. Good projects all north of, you know, seven figure projects in a couple a year, which is great. That's like a really important, you know, model for us.  \nMe: Awesome. Yeah.  \nThem: And then this year, I think the other piece that's been really exciting that, you know, was part of our growth plan was just showing up at all of those US Based cultural moments. Like, we have been winning those projects to sort of be like, all right, we'll be at World cup or Visa with some really big projects. We'll be, you know, hopefully at the Super Bowl. It seems like this year we have a project in south by Southwest, like some of those big moments. We did two projects at Cannes, Lyons, last year or, you know, this past year.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So just, you know, sort of showing up and, you know, being highly visible in the moments where a lot of, you know, our clients and brands do want to be, and they want to see us having experience in those spaces. So that's been also really great.  \nMe: Yeah. Awesome.  \nThem: On the team front, I think. We started the year with a bit of a promise that, like, the biggest thing we needed to evolve and grow was on. On the creative studio side.  \nMe: Creat. Ive studio.  \nThem: That was like, our. Our largest challenge, I think so. You know, my background. I've led both production and creative teams, but I'm a producer by trade. I was a producer coming up all through my agency life.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: So not only have I had, like, I think, a depth of connections there, I really. It's really easy for me to, like, identify what we're hiring for. I. And. And it's a little bit, you know, as a producer, I can. I can say this with consideration, which is, like, it's a little. Bit easier to hire a four, I think, you know. It's easy to spot the talent. The tasks are relatively tactical. You hope you can find this soft skills in the cultural components of it. But it's less as important to do that for the work product. So you can hire like a wider breadth, I think of types of talents from different backgrounds. On the production side. And be sure that they can, like, complete the work. Like, just because doing B2B conferences for years doesn't mean that, like, they can't do the work that we're doing.  \nMe: But. Product. So you can. Hire. Different. Background. S. Yeah. Sure.  \nThem: We're, like, on the creative and design side, you know, that can be, like, a little bit of a challenging transition, like, whether the taste is there.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: So I think we've had obviously, like, you know, we started the year with mct. That didn't work out. Tough transition for the team. We've obviously released a couple more folks with us. I think Elon came through. You guys, right? Elon born.  \nMe: Stop. Being worked out. You see the designer? Designer. Yeah, that was Woody.  \nThem: Designer. Director. Yeah. So that's, you know, that we've kind of built that. That team a little bit. We had one departure outside of McTee, and then we had one design director that. So we. We've had some turmoil.  \nMe: And. The gift. Design. Yeah.  \nThem: On that team.  \nMe: Yeah. All based in new york, right?  \nThem: All based in New York. Everybody's in America. We had one design director on the architecture side that was 3D. Made it about, like, seven or eight months.  \nMe: Yeah. I remember. I remember Jeb telling me about him. Can't remember the guy's name, but came from re.  \nThem: We didn't. It was Rob. Yeah, Rob. Yeah, yeah. So that he didn't, you know, that didn't work out. So there's been some turnover. There's been, you know, like, on that team, I would say the greatest amount of turnover for the smallest team that we have. You know what I mean? So, like, they really. Feel it.  \nMe: That was it. Rob. Yeah. Yeah. Nicky and Nikki's getting on all right now.  \nThem: Nikki is doing wonderfully. I've actually worked on. She's working on some TV projects now that I support that client. So back to Sierra in action. She's really lovely to work with. I think she's a really good cultural fit for our team. Also. I think it's probably about, like, trying to woo her over time to see if she wants to join the gang. But it's she's a great pair of hands and I think having her embedded has given her the opportunity to work with at a little bit more. I think one of the things that we noticed.  \nMe: I think. Probably. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah.  \nThem: Pretty quickly with Ed joining the team, or I've noticed, is like, we have this promise that we want to elevate brand experience here in the US. But we're out there looking for talent here, and then not necessarily happy with what we're getting. We're going to have to do some teaching, right? Like, we're going to have to do some coaching to get some of the folks to the place where we want to be. The taste will be there, may be really excellent in their craft, but without some support to do it the Amplify way at the level that we expected at the pace that we expected, it would be really difficult. So I'm hoping that we can, like, continue a little bit our thoughts on, like, creating a tapestry of talent, as Jeb likes to say, but also having some bones and foundation in place to support those people when they join.  \nMe: Yes. Y. Es, yes. Y. Es. Absolutely. No, no, that makes a hell of a lot of sense.  \nThem: Yeah. Future is bright without joining. I think it'll help a lot to have people that. And, you know, we've had Jordan, one of our global creative directors, over on, like, a second, so he's been with us for six weeks.  \nMe: Jordan.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Yeah, we placed Jordan ages ago. Legend absolutely love him.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Jordan's out in New York for a little bit. He's been here, and he'll be here through, like, mid December. Also just, you know, that gives a little bit of opportunity to see somebody else in action for the teammates. So, you know, a lot, like, I would say, like, our biggest challenge is probably still there. In just finding the right people, we probably need to hire to give you a sense, like, to meet the work capacity that we have.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: Easily another four to five roles in the studio.  \nMe: Es. Yes. Wow.  \nThem: And ideally in, like, H1, basically, you know, so.  \nMe: Okay? And when you. When you say in the studio, If you were to map it, what would they look like? What? Those roles.  \nThem: Yeah. We have no 3D designers on the two. We have no architects on the team at all.  \nMe: Yeah, we're working. We're working quite. I was gonna say aggressively, but that sounds angry. But we're very much on top of the architecture architect role for you. It's an interesting one. The person did out and the creative team, he used to be an architect.  \nThem: All.  \nMe: So he gets it.  \nThem: Y. Es.  \nMe: He's head hunting and scout, like, scoping the New York right now. So 3D. Yeah.  \nThem: Three up, two in, you know, probably one. I mean, they're both probably, like, midweight to senior.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Yeah. So, you know, that's one space. Let me see on the 2D design side, because I think we had. Yeah, here we go. I mean, realistically, probably. Here we go. 2D designer. We have one in from March and one in from May, but my guess is that I think one of the ones on the team might not work out.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Yeah, with a more junior one, not one you placed.  \nMe: No. Okay. So that's your 2D designer? Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah. So I think we had already two in the bunch for next year. We might need one replacement.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Yeah.  \nThem: Make sense. So I think we would start seeing candidates right away if we could. And if there was anybody interesting, we would hire them, if that makes sense.  \nMe: Okay? Okay?  \nThem: We're already still going out to a lot of freelance.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: On that.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So that. That, you know, somewhere in the neighborhood of 3, 2, 3 Ds. 2, 2 D at minimum, possibly 3. And then the creative directors. It's kind of an interesting one because I know, you know, you introduce to Michael. For the ecd role, michael.  \nMe: Oh. Yeah. Michael. You? Yeah, yeah.  \nThem: You. Did you know he was freelancing with us? Did he talk to you about it?  \nMe: No. Okay. Sorry, I didn't.  \nThem: He just started. So we had. A senior creative director who is. Who has left? Her name is Michi. Oh, here.  \nMe: Yes. Yep, I know. Yeah, I've heard of michi.  \nThem: Michi is going over Giant spoon. Now I'll give you the industry Goss shoot.  \nMe: Okay, that was. That. That was not me. Okay, sure.  \nThem: I know it was Monica.  \nMe: You. Yeah. I'm sorry I've made this happen so far.  \nThem: It was monica. Yeah.  \nMe: I do love Monica, but. Yeah, damn you. Okay, so, okay.  \nThem: Like jigsaw and you try to place it.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay?  \nThem: Yeah. So I did talk to Jev about it, and he mentioned that here's the thing. I've never also seen full transparency. I've never seen a contract that you guys have. But he did mention to me that basically, freelancers with you, there's a year expiration on intro. And then if. We need to freelance with somebody we can. Is that true?  \nMe: Okay? To an extent, yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, and also, we all know I want the long lasting relationship that we have.  \nThem: Yes. Well, admittedly, Michi, on her way out, was like, I'm friends with Michael. She didn't know that we had ever interviewed him for the EC role and was sort of like, he's free. As my potential replacement because she was leaving a big gap on a project.  \nMe: Right. Okay? Right.  \nThem: That's how it actually came to pass. But then I realized he had also been part of the ecd. So, checked with Jeff. Sure, we were good.  \nMe: Yes. Yes.  \nThem: But yeah, so he's freelancing with us, but only until the end of February. And he was a replacement role, obviously, for Michi, who is like a group creative director.  \nMe: Okay? Yeah.  \nThem: Love. So we'll have that group creative director role. And we have one more. Just make sure. We have one more in the budge on the group creative director role.  \nMe: I. Have. Sorry for not looping you in. Sorry for not looping you in on this, but I did introduce Ed to somebody last. End of last week called Lav From Dayan. Have you heard about her?  \nThem: Yeah, I've heard about Taeyeon.  \nMe: Yeah. So they're meeting tomorrow, and she's pulling a debt together to talk Jevon and Ed through some. Some work.  \nThem: Yeah. Six.  \nMe: She's really cool. She's, like, looking at about 200k for a perm roll they've offered her, just so you're aware, so you can manage expectations internally. She has been offered a CD gig at Dayyan to run the Meta account, but she knows that if she accepts that she's going to be on Meta for the next three years. And she's already been on it for a couple of years. She wants diversity in a variety of accounts, and she's just a. She's absolutely lovely as well. She's just a real all of energy. So she can start pretty quickly at the same time because she's, like, in this flux period where she's like.  \nThem: Yes. Yes. Y. Es. She's either gonna have to make a choice.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And, you know, there may be a little bit of conversation around that it seems like probably.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But I think that's okay.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Good to know. So it's basically 2, 2D, 2, 3. I'm saying this like we have them at different. We have them tempered at different times between January and June, but it doesn't matter, right? Because it's like so much talent when you have six roles, like, it's a little bit. Of a jigsaw puzzle. So whoever find first, we would hire first, you know?  \nMe: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah, I get that.  \nThem: Really stopping us. And truth be told, I don't think anybody would be sitting on their hands. Right? Because even from February, it's already November. End of November, it's December, let's call it. Somebody in the budget from February. On the creative director side. Same on 2d and 3d.  \nMe: And I guess the other thing is, if. If we don't get Nikki over the line for a permanent role, does that open up another opportunity as well? Because I know that she's doing.  \nThem: So it's actually kind of interesting the way we have the two CDS that I was talking about. Let me say this.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Michael's role that he's sort of holding the space for that opens in February, and then have another role that's basically either Nikki or someone else.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: From the end of her contract from Mayfoward does that? Yeah. So it's like, basically we have two freelancers, Michael and Nikki. One ends in February. We need to replace that. Nikki, we'd need to replace by May.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay? Okay, cool. So.  \nThem: Or it could be right.  \nMe: That could be who? Sorry.  \nThem: Or it could be Nikki.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah. What if there could be could there be an opportunity for love? Is there a permanent hire for love? If I'm reading between the lines.  \nThem: If she was ready to go, I think we would make an immediate call and just hire her from January 1st.  \nMe: Right. Okay, cool. I got you. Fair enough. I think I. I think she would be keen on that, frankly. So, hopefully, Jevin, And yeah.  \nThem: It's the right fit. I think so, because, like I said, we have that in from March, essentially.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And so we can play with this.  \nMe: You know what? Okay? I think I'm really clear on this now. That's really. Thank you for giving me so. Like, for being so granular. Really, really helps as well. Seriously.  \nThem: Because I'm holding all this information, and I know also. Look, Javin and I are going to continue to be the heart of this conversation. They're going to know I want the team to go, but I don't expect them to have this level of detail, if that makes sense.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no to their creative people. So they don't want to get caught up in all of this stuff. And, and you are right. We are acting on, we need to probably be a little bit hotter on, on the contract side of things. We have, you know, because we have such deep relationship with them. It's a very trustworthy kind of. Oh, yeah. It's like 18% on a higher. Or it's on a project by project basis. Like, for example, when I did the ECD search, I think we lowered that to 16 because they paid more up front. I'm happy to kind of work things around that. Because I've got a long lasting partnership, I think, with the, with the candidate ownership side of things, like Jevons kind of alluding to with, with Michael. I would be interested. I think that technically wouldn't sit with you would I wouldn't be owed a fee on that from introduction because it works for an ECD search.  \nThem: Right. Yep.  \nMe: That said, it's nice to be acknowledged that it was us at the same time. So it's kind of like, because in my head, I was like, okay, well, maybe it would work if we took a percentage of the day rate until the end of the year. But then I was actually thinking, actually, I'm not too sure.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: How that works. Maybe I just need to sit on it and think about it, to be honest. But ultimately, Jess, I don't want to. I don't want to screw anyone over. I feel. I truly feel like an equally I know you value our partnership as much as I do, and there's plenty more stuff around the corner, so I don't want a bit of get caught up on one thing. But equally as you sure you can appreciate. That is our IP making those very smart introductions. And that's what keeps the lights on. So we can continue to do it. But. But I think what I. So let's talk about going forward then, in 2026 with these particular. It sounds like. So let me just get this case. I've written this down like two. Two Ds.  \nThem: Yes. Y. Es. Yes.  \nMe: Two, three D's and one's. And one of those would be like a proper architect, right?  \nThem: Yep. Yeah, we have them both just listed as three. You know, architect, 3D designer, you know, to give you a salary range.  \nMe: Okay? And then two, then two cd.  \nThem: 180 ish. Yeah. And then 2d.  \nMe: Okay? Okay, so let me just. So we got 150. To. Did he say 200? Sorry. Or 1? Eight.  \nThem: 150 to 180 on the arch.  \nMe: 1 8. Great. Okay, cool. And then two Ds. What do you have in the budget for this?  \nThem: So for 2D we have a more junior from January. At 120.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And then we have a more senior. One senior. To Midway, I'll say at about, let's say, 140 to 160.  \nMe: Okay? Cool. And what do you have for the CDS budget?  \nThem: Yes. So the cds.  \nMe: So now we're paying a Nikki 220 Pro Rasa.  \nThem: Yes. So to give you a sense, there's a range between the two roles and we can play it. Doesn't matter which one goes first, but I would say 180 to 220.  \nMe: Okay, cool.  \nThem: It's a big range, but I think one of the roles probably more solidly a creative director, one role is more solidly like a group creative director level or senior creative director level.  \nMe: Creative director. Y. Es. Yeah, totally. Okay. Cool. So you've got a really healthy budget here as well to kind of play with. Which is really interesting. Okay, cool, so. There's two ways, I think so. One, we could do what we would probably call like a project fee. So the design team will support across all of them. I will support my team will support across creative as well. I'll go away and I'll do the maths on what that could look like. Usually, how our process would work was on a. It'd be calculated on a percentage of the fee and because it's five rolls. Sorry, six rolls, including two cds we could look at probably reducing the fee, which might be. Kind of. Might be easy to talk to the CFO about, frankly. But what I'll need to do is I'll have to go away and I'll have to go and work those costs out, frankly.  \nThem: Okay? Yes. Y. Es.  \nMe: We could do from 18 to 16% more, like, slightly more upfront, less on completion. Like, we've worked in a typical capacity like that before, but certainly we could basically come in and go, okay, well, we're going to be super on it with all of these hires now that we're super clear on. Every single one. Give us your priority ones. We'll focus on them and we'll make sure that they're closed by X date and make sure that you have X amount of interviews by X date as well.  \nThem: Yes. Yes.  \nMe: I think that's probably. I'll go away and talk to Woody as well, who's running the design team to talk about which roles does he actually working on. I know amplifiers names and flying around being like, I'm talking to Ed today and talking to this designer and this architect. So I'm like, okay, they're on it. They're doing stuff. So they're already on top of things, which is great. And then for creatives, that's something that I can be an always on. Just like, so how we worked in the past, what I said. So we raised an invoice. I think it was for 12k in April, May this year for creative searches. And what that was was essentially a credit note, which was then used to be taken off a future creative hire. And what that meant it wasn't written down kind of in black and white. This is me and Jevin on the phone being like, look, I'M going to get you as many people as we can and start building this pipeline of talent, and then that fee is then taken off. And that's exactly what's happened with Nikki in the recent invoice that I've raised.  \nThem: Y. Es. Y. Es. Y. Es. Yes. Yes. Yes. Y. Es. Y. Es. Right. Yep.  \nMe: That's quite a new progressive way and something that we're trying. So when I talk about the bench model, that's a really interesting thing for freelancing particular, I presume you already have, like, a little black book of people that you kind of dip into, or you still using recruiters?  \nThem: No, I mean, it is a little bit of a mix. Sometimes we'll use to drum up specific roles. I would say that they're more production design roles than they are any creative directors. I would say we're probably thinnest in the CD front.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay?  \nThem: But as we place full time hires there, I would imagine that our need for that in a freelance role will decrease. I think we'll always need the 2D and 3D freelance roles.  \nMe: Yeah, fair enough.  \nThem: And so, you know, graphic designers, architects, motion designers. Those will always I think of freelance for even if we have a full time team, it's just like, you know, the work and projects facing sometimes means that we have to go out. So I would say yeah, we have a book. We sometimes go to recruiters 2D. 3D. Mostly. We don't really go to anybody but you guys for creative directors.  \nMe: Yes. Great. To hear.  \nThem: In terms of they're hard to come by. So I think it's either people in our network.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Or we're trusting you guys to kind of help us find that talent. And I know that anybody that Jeb and Ed have vetted that has come through, you guys feel confident about. So there's that trust there.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So, yeah, the bench model. I mean, I guess what I'd like to understand a little bit more for sure, go away and look at it as breath. With the roles for the first half of the year, I think what we want to get to is one, I want to make sure we're doing right by you. Guys.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: From an introductions perspective or whatever, that there's clarity there. And so that we can always hold up our end of the bargain for relationship perspective. I think also for us from a budgeting perspective, it's helpful to get a handle like, all right, we've got these six roles. What is that going to look like for spend for us, January to June and then I think from there a little bit more structure around, like as you were sort of talking about. One thing I've noticed is like Mark, myself, Zoe, we get super busy. I can only imagine that Jev and Ed's time is at a premium as well.  \nMe: Yes. Y. Es. Yes. Y. Es. Y. Es. Y. Es. Y. Es.  \nThem: And one thing that I'll give you an example on the production and account management side.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: I have a recruiter that I'm working with based in Brooklyn. They've placed quite a few producers with us, so now they kind of know what we're doing. We are working on a weekly rate model with them.  \nMe: Y. Es. Y. Es. Y. Es.  \nThem: But there are some guarantees in that on placement, and we've also structured in.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Like, we're going to do speed dates on this day. We're going to be eight candidates on that day. We're going to move into second round and task and we're going to be complete with that search by this day. We have three roles that you can prioritize at once, and then we can adjust those when we found a role, for instance, and that's actually working pretty well.  \nMe: Yeah. Interesting. So that's the set. That's a set fee per placement.  \nThem: It's a set fee in weekly fee and then we don't have a set fee for placement, but we essentially have a guarantee for a number of roles placed in a three month period. Does that make.  \nMe: Okay? Yes, it's really unique. It's really interesting, actually. So you're working with. So she is. Sorry. They're getting a set fee. Per week. Okay, and then that. But then for any introduction, there's no extra cost. Okay, cool.  \nThem: Up. Correct. So it's different.  \nMe: Do you know what that fee is? It might just help me.  \nThem: Yeah. Let me just double check. I think we negotiated for a three month period to be at about. 3k per week. I want to say it was like, okay, per month.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Per month.  \nThem: About 12k per month.  \nMe: Okay per month. Very interesting. Yeah. So what we were saying about the bench model.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Would work in a similar capacity. However, there'd be, let's say, You brief us on these roles across strategy, account handling as well. We've got the team that can kind of support that now. It would cost between 15 and 20k up front, but it's a curated bench of talent. You're guaranteed X amount within that month. And then there's an ongoing very much reduced rate. For, let's say, six months, where we completely manage your freelance pool. And also they're paid via us, which is another interesting thing, which is something that we've had to work very closely with a provider with, which is pretty wild.  \nThem: Yes, the incidence of us labor laws. Aren't you there, sam?  \nMe: And what I mean by that kind of reduced rate, it means you're playing a flat fee per placement rather than 18% of a day rate, which then, as you know, adds up and up and up. But because there's been money paid for at the very beginning, which is larger than what it's like. A bet. In a way, it's like, okay, well, we're betting we're going to save money across the entire year for our recruitment spend.  \nThem: Yes. Yes. Y. Es. Yes. Yes.  \nMe: And it seems to be what we've just trialled it with a new company that we've partnered with in New York. We're very close to kind of launching that. So I think it's going to be quite successful. I think the thing with this is we now hold my hands up to this. We were never set up to be, like, the ultimate freelance recruiters. We were really, really good at finding exceptionally talented humans from different parts of the world and kind of classic parts of the world as well. And I think what differentiated us was our taste and kind of brand and the way that we talked to talent, et cetera, which can only really gauge from having a one to one like. This, to be honest.  \nThem: Y. Es.  \nMe: But we just grew and grew to a point where we were running too many searches and we couldn't provide the next day producer or the next day account handle or the next day creative director. And we're hoping that this freelance model is more sustainable for our partners, like yourself, frankly. So we've got a managing partner of Freelance that manages that team called Karina. She's great. Super experienced as well.  \nThem: Yes. Y. Es.  \nMe: And the team would just kind of. Absolutely on it, frankly.  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: It's an interesting shape model. Can I just go and digest that with my team and think about a creative way that we might be able to support you in that area around creatives as well?  \nThem: Y. Es. For sure. At that model. That model is actually for just to give you a sense, we do work with that same company in a freelance model. Just give you insight into other that we work with them. The freelance model is similar to the one that you're talking about with your bench.  \nMe: Cool. Yeah.  \nThem: I don't know how they're running their searches on their end internally, but what I can tell you is we get a flat fee. They pay them, we pay them. We pay the recruiter, pays the team. So when we're seeing a flat fee, which just really helps us, I think it helps agencies on. The budgeting side. Right, like we're not later essentially assessing a recruiting fee against the project work.  \nMe: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: Which should essentially be sitting on our overhead rate. So for us, then, we don't split that out. We're like, that's cost of that freelancer. We don't split out any recruitment component of that. And we're able to budget on that project and gauge our profitability on them individually.  \nMe: Yeah. Yep. Yep.  \nThem: So on the freelance side, that's how we're working with them. If we work with them to gain producers, project managers, et cetera.  \nMe: Makes.  \nThem: If the other model, that's more of that. What they call the retained model is for full time searches.  \nMe: Okay? Yeah.  \nThem: So that, I think is, like, it's still ultimately our biggest priority, I would say, because for us, my goal for the studio is to have a bench of. Like five to ten in each discipline at most because slotting them in, I really just want to be able to availability check with those people and then replace them if need be. If they get a full time role or no longer a freelancing.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Yeah.  \nThem: And I want those people coming back to us all the time.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Right. Ideally, that's the goal. So I do think it's almost like as much as it's still proof that we haven't fully cracked, it's an easier brief than finding, like, six new roles in the first half next year. And it's great because I think that aligns with what you've been able to support us with is like, you know, the taste, you know, the agency. No Amplify. And you're able to support in that way. So I think those two things would love to hear more, like, please go away and like, about what you know would work best. I'm happy to. Chat again after the Thanksgiving holidays.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Y. Es. Y. Es. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. When? When. When are you back from Thanksgiving?  \nThem: We're back on Monday.  \nMe: You're back on Monday, okay?  \nThem: Out from tomorrow, and then I'm back on the first.  \nMe: Great. Okay. I definitely for the permanent hires, the two Ds, three Ds Cds, I definitely think a set project fee because they're permanent hires. That is something that we could look at. I just would. Do you have like a total budget that you're trying to work to. Because that might be a simple way of what is that? Because I might be able to work it out pretty quickly what the upfront would be.  \nThem: But let me see. Okay, hold on one moment. If you don't mind.  \nMe: It's okay.  \nThem: Okay, let's see here. That's Creative Director.  \nMe: Nearly. Okay, looks like you've got it on the lower scale. It looks like you've got 900k worth of salaries. That's with. Two. That's with one junior, two D. One kind of midweight senior, 2D2 3DS and an architect and then two cds as well. That's between 900 and a million in salary.  \nThem: Yeah. I have somewhere in that neighborhood.  \nMe: Yeah. So if I just do it based off. A 900 as the lowest. Just to make it lives easier. The total recruiting fees is 162 at 18%. Typically. There's two ways that we work up to a certain salary and then they are calculated discretion, like on a case by case basis. But general rule of thumb is we charge 30% up front and then that's a split fee. Then that comes off the final fee. So it would look somewhere between 40 and 50. Up front. For all six. Which you know, you know. It's kind of. That's. I guess, just like I said, it will go away and we'll work it out. But that's kind of where my head would be going if we were to commit to those six roles. I do have a question. How does it work with getting it signed off and CFOs and things like that? How does. What do we need to do to get signed off? Are you?  \nThem: It'll be, you know, all report in. We've budgeted for what we need, so I'll need to look at how that's sort of invoice across each one, I think, and then.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay? Could it be that we do it in kind of. Let's prioritize three roles and then maybe Q1 and then Q2, perhaps.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Yeah, something like that. Definitely. And, you know, I think it's like, So you're saying a 40 to 50k upfront and then based and then what? What would be the close you think as each role is hired?  \nMe: That would depend on the salary. But just looking at the maths again, so the total was 160.  \nThem: Y.  \nMe: 2 recruitment fee over the 6 roles.  \nThem: Es.  \nMe: And then when I've done 30% up front, it says it's 48. Let me just. Let me just work out If I go 62. If we put it in at 45, because that's between it, so probably looking at about 117.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Closing.  \nThem: Okay? So basically, it's just an upfront on the 18%.  \nMe: Yeah. What, what, what. What I would like to do, though, is I would like to go away with my team, and I'd like to say particularly my. My FD and my. My MD. I'd be like, look, I'm prefer looking to commit to six roles over the. Over the course of six months in H1.  \nThem: Yes. Y. Es. Yes.  \nMe: Can we look at. Can we look at creative ways that we can structure this and that might look like, okay.  \nThem: Y. Es.  \nMe: Well, maybe it's more up front, but less on completion and less. And what I mean by that is the overall fee comes down because if it's across six roles and it's across salary range of nearly a million, that's it's a commitment up front from both part of, you know, so. I just think.  \nThem: Yes. Y. Es. Y. Eah. That's. That's what I think we want to get to is ultimately like, if we have a large amount of roles to hire for. And, you know, I think there's a lot of interesting ways to do that. The way that, the way that we're working it with the production companies, we have somebody that's kind of available to, you know, they're almost dedicated to us 15, 20 hours a week.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Great. Great.  \nThem: Essentially.  \nMe: Great. Yeah. Cool.  \nThem: And they're managing, like, you know, a spreadsheet on all the roles. They're in constant communication with us, they're in a gchat with us.  \nMe: Yeah. We. We have that as well, with a couple of clients as well. We're in their Slack channels. In some cases, we've actually got emails to help arrange it, which makes everybody's life a little bit easier. There's a. There's a set fee for that as well. We call that a consultancy. Fee. So we do that with the midnight club. We do that with raw materials. We're doing it with an influencer agency called Buttermilk, and that is more like an embedded solution, as it were. We can certainly look at doing that with purely creative and design as well. I think that's quite possible.  \nThem: Yeah. Y. Es. Yes. Y. Es. Yes. Yes. Right. Have a think about it. I think, like, we're open to a lot of different options, and basically what I want to make sure is that one we.  \nMe: Yeah. Cool.  \nThem: Important takeaways is like we're scaling pretty quickly. Us obviously, like six roles is a lot million dollars of latte, Chris.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: You're obviously so like, you know, we, I, we're trying to move heavily from a freelance model to a full time model. So what are the best ways that we can, like, support that as a process, which I think means being as efficient as possible?  \nMe: 100%.  \nThem: Too. And then, of course, as being as transparent as we can to plan in, you know, what we can do there. This is like. Even still, I will say. I would say it's like, a conservative number. Like, we still work in a ton of briefs, and so I. Yeah.  \nMe: Really? Okay, so it's a conservative number. Fair enough. Well, look.  \nThem: Right? Like, it could go up, it could go slightly down, but I think it's, like, where we're projecting it to, so.  \nMe: S like you make the most of the moments where you are hitting with momentum. And you guys deserve it because you've been working so hard for the last few years. And it's so nice to see it all come together. So if we can help you find those people that are really going to help Elevate and continue that momentum like God. We would love to help do that for sure.  \nThem: So. Y. Eah. Chatting in June and be like, okay, we have the building blocks there, you know?  \nMe: I tell you what I want to be in Cannes Lions on the Pinterest event that you've made. Having a cocktail going like, okay, we've done it. We've set up. That's the goal. That's the goal, yes.  \nThem: Y. Es. Yes. Yeah, for sure. All right, well, let's chat next week.  \nMe: Yes. Let's try next week when you're back from Thanksgiving. I could probably do the same time next week, actually, but if you're around.  \nThem: Yeah. This is next Tuesday at around 9 my time. Let me just take a look. Next Tuesday around. I have. I have a little bit later, which kind of sucks for you, but I have 10.  \nMe: So cool. I can do 10.  \nThem: Year time.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: All right, I'm just going to throw that in for right now.  \nMe: Great. What a movie you're going to do. And I'm going to Give me. Give me a day. I know that you're about to go on Thanksgiving. That's fine. But instead of a really long, lengthy email, I'm just going to pull a PDF together of a few different options so you can just digest it and if you need to share it with anybody internally,  \nThem: Yes. Yep. Yeah.  \nMe: Or have any questions, just let me know, because I'm often aware that things can get lost in emails, and if it's in a PDF, it might just be easier to control.  \nThem: I think that's a great idea.  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: Yeah, I'll just say I'm gonna. Jev, I was supposed to talk to him yesterday. His little was sick, so I didn't get to chat with him. But I will flip him just a quick note. To let him know. I think he's gonna be excited that we're working through things, but I'll just let. I'll give him visibility that we're chatting. I had invited Ed to this last one, but he's off on vacation, so I don't know if he was actually.  \nMe: Is it that guy? I feel so bad. I always text him when he's on vacation.  \nThem: The answer.  \nMe: Yeah, he does. He's like, I know. I just don't know. I mean, he's like, WhatsApp to say, Like, I'm on holiday or something like that. And he's also meeting a candidate. He's meeting Lav tomorrow.  \nThem: He probably was just like, I think I. I have one meeting. I'm supposed to be off tomorrow. I have one meeting. He was probably just like, just. I'll just do this so that it keeps moving in the background. But I'm excited about this candidate. That's really great news.  \nMe: Do you want me to share her details with you? So you're away? Yeah.  \nThem: Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Happy to take a look. You know, I'm sure we'll get the process, but that's exciting.  \nMe: Okay? Yeah, it's really cool.  \nThem: Hopefully. Hopefully. That's a good get.  \nMe: Hopefully. Hopefully. That'd be really cool.  \nThem: Crossed off the list.  \nMe: Yeah, that'd be easy. And then it would probably impact what the overall thing for next year would look like anyway, which is cool.  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: Anyway, look, thank you so much for your time, Jess. It's really nice to actually meet you. And I'm keen to continue chatting and making this work. It's going to be a cool six months.  \nThem: Y. Es. Y. Es.  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: Absolutely. All right, well, let's talk soon. I'll see you next Tuesday latest.  \nMe: Sweet. All right, thanks, jess. Bye. Bye."
