  "full_transcript": "Them: Hey. Good morning.  \nMe: Hey, how are you?  \nThem: Good. How are you?  \nMe: I'm very well, thank you. Very well.  \nThem: Gosh.  \nMe: What's going on?  \nThem: Tuesday. Everything. So it's the week before, like Thursday's holiday.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So people are, like, working, but they're remotely, which means most people are just sort of checking their phones, which is a very interesting. Hybrid sort of thing. Because when you went to an office, you were either in or you were out. So dealing with the repercussions of that.  \nMe: Okay, interesting.  \nThem: Yeah, it's funny, Maggie.  \nMe: Within your particular team or just in general?  \nThem: Oh, yeah. No. 1,000% within my team. It's funny because Maggie and I canceled everything to show up, and everybody else was like, I'll be available that aren't available. And you're like, here's the thing. At a certain point, your job is seven days a week. It doesn't. Mean that you work all seven. It just means, like, nobody's coming to save you. So if something happens, you own a business. You're like, I should show up for this? Because if I don't show up and set the example, Then other people don't show up. And also, who's going to do the thing? Right, so the things this week are like all sorts of things. Yeah, I wanted to connect because this is something. I'll be super transparent.  \nMe: This is. Something that will be super. Transparent.  \nThem: Maggie's hard to figure out. Sometimes. She's not as direct as she thinks she is.  \nMe: Now. You start to figure out sometimes. It's not a direct. Ion.  \nThem: So she's like, yes, let's talk to Sam. We need talent. We have a talent issue. I was like, 1,000%. We have a talent issue, and it stems from a lot of things. No finger pointing, but I think what we're seeing right now, particularly there's pieces of business that are disappearing. One either because they're just shrinking because of industry. And certain ones weren't managed well because we hired people based on, like, you could be the managing director, you should be, and you were like, that's the person ever done that before. So if it's everybody's first time at the rodeo,  \nMe: Right now. Particular. Ly that. Are. You want? To make sure. You have. Direct. Okay? Yeah.  \nThem: It's not the most interesting rodeo or the nest rodeo you've ever seen, has it? Like, one or two people? Fine, everybody. So Joanna and I are dealing kind of with that. And Maggie's fully aware. She's like, yes, but as we're dropping certain things,  \nMe: So inexperience for sure.  \nThem: Inexperience and a little bit of know. Maggie has this thing where she's like, I believe in you so much. And I'm like, but why? Right. And this is where I are more curious people when it comes to. But theoretically, I would like to believe in everybody, but also.  \nMe: Right.  \nThem: We need to do a little research. So what's interesting right now?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And I talked to my chief operating officer, and she's like, stagball. 100% agrees. We have a huge talent issue, like, massive talent issue on account and strategy fronts.  \nMe: Okay? Right.  \nThem: Creative. We're making it work. But if they can't do their part, it's kind of hard just to sell our part.  \nMe: Kind of. Hard.  \nThem: So that's been really challenging. So there's a little bit of this come to Jesus. And I think Maggie's now slowing.  \nMe: To. See in this, I think. Back now.  \nThem: Her jets a bit. Going into 2026 because all of a sudden, scopes weren't renewed.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: So either. They naturally shrank because business is not good in those businesses weren't going to scale anyways, like DSW. DSW. Oh, wow, $2 million. I'm like, they'll have $2 million once every three years. That is not a guaranteed 2 million per year.  \nMe: This is. Not good. Scale. Anyway. Like cf. Oh. Half a million dollars. That. Is not a character.  \nThem: You know, so a lot of the things that they were hoping to scale without really understanding how, like, the larger marketing business works, being, like, they're not going to do a full rebrand.  \nMe: Market. Ing this is. Working. Like 30. Two.  \nThem: At least for 18 to 36 months.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: So I think there's, like, a little bit of that. And now she's like, oh, shit. So she's like, okay, we don't have as much revenue going into 2026. We're. I'll be honest, we're down, like, 10 million from where we are here. Yeah.  \nMe: So. She's like, okay. We don't. Have a. Budget. Revenue going into. 20 20. Or all the. Cost reduction. 10 million. Oh, shit. Where were you at the beginning?  \nThem: 36 million.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Problem. We're staffed like a 48 million dollar agency right now.  \nMe: Yeah. So this very much. Jesus. Sounds very bloated.  \nThem: It's loaded in the wrong ways, and I'll. I'm just like. I just wanted to tell you.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: This is what I learned this week. So. We all know systems are designed to break. That's why you make a system, so you can pinpoint the parts that are not quite right. And you keep tweaking the system because everybody's like, I kind of see what it is.  \nMe: Kind of.  \nThem: But we keep optimizing it. But if you're like, systems. Break a system and there's no system, then there's chaos. And that's what we're dealing with now is being like, well, how do we put a system in place? Because now we have on paper. I'm going to make a. I'll say we have 10 products we sell when really we need to be selling three.  \nMe: But. If. We're. Doing right now? We. Are on paper. On. The. 10. Top. Real.  \nThem: Right. So there's this, like, right, sizing of what are we selling?  \nMe: Estell. E.  \nThem: And based on what we're selling, what are we charging for it? And based on what we're charging for it, what are the types of roles we need scoped? So, like, mmi, they're like a designer. As a designer, I'm like, well, no, there's production designers, there's motion. Designers. There's. Yeah, like, brand, right. There's people that are more like illustration based. Like, you have to kind of really dig into it to be like, this is the skill set. And some people are hybrids of those. Their expectation is a designer is a designer. So if I tell you to design things, you're going to do it. So when you take a really killer brand designer, like somebody Steve brought in,  \nMe: And based on. What we're selling. We're on charge for. It. And based on what? We're charging for it. What are the types of. Gold we need. So, like. Mmonic. Design. Ers. Graphic. There's branding identity. Yeah. Something. Similar. Grand design. Like my. Default.  \nThem: You're like, make me 400 oral care banner ads that have fine.  \nMe: I got to tell you. To f off.  \nThem: Well, no, they're in positions because they're like kids, and they're like, I need a job. So there's a fundamental misalignment of values. So we're getting burnout. It's taking them way longer to do things because it's not how their brain works. And two they've been scoped as something that they're not.  \nMe: Okay? Way longer. If you think. That. They're not.  \nThem: And I'm like, you know, I would charge way different for a brand designer versus a production designer. So this is the thing that I'm like, you guys, you know, you can't charge the same money for that, and that's a completely different skill set. So the issue is, like, much larger. So there's this, like, slow your role. And now I'm like, great. I have to put all the job descriptions down across performance marketing, brand marketing, and social marketing to teach people the difference so we could charge correctly for what we have.  \nMe: For. A brand design. People. The difference? So we discover. Personally from what we. Have.  \nThem: Because my guess is even though we're going in with 26 million, top secret, it's probably closer to, like, 30, 32 million. We're, like, really off in what we're scoping.  \nMe: Because. I have to keep them. Looking at the. 26 million. Top secret. Okay?  \nThem: Because the MMI folks are like, you just charge a flat fee, and then you say yes to everything, and then somebody just does it. So they don't really have, like, what are those, like, racy plans? Responsible, accountable. I forget the other two, but, like, there's no sort of understanding of how, like, the machine needs to work in order to scale the machine.  \nMe: Right. Now. Yeah.  \nThem: So right now, our biggest issue is growth. And I can say transparently now, Maggie has put somebody who was like, on the influencer team. She is the most gregarious, bright, shiny, well spoken, likable human.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: No shit about the business we're in. Knows nothing about if a client says, Hey, by the way, I know you're doing my performance marketing. Can you also write us a campaign? For the same flat fee is like.  \nMe: Where does this person come from?  \nThem: Texas mmi.  \nMe: I go. Okay?  \nThem: So we have a problem where the MMI folks are not necessarily smart to the larger picture.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.  \nThem: Some of them are getting it and they're doing great. Other ones have sort of gone on maternity leave and never come back, but we need to shed a lot of people also. From there because they don't understand what they're selling. So the biggest problem right now is our growth team. We have a cmo. He comes from a PR background. He's wpp PR background. He doesn't know what he doesn't know, but he's brilliant. He's smart, he gets it. He's a Stephen Bonson. You're a really excellent, excellent guy for somebody who's never done the job.  \nMe: Really? Excellent. Cool.  \nThem: You're. Like this guy can do the job.  \nMe: So it says. He kind of the head of growth. So he's cmo, he's chief.  \nThem: He is. Look at this. Because Maggie hired her friends in, they all report to her.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay, so there's like a. Mis.  \nThem: I can't tell these people what to do because they go and they run to her. So my role was baggy. Now it's like Maggie.  \nMe: Yeah, I got you.  \nThem: Do you see how that's, like, kind of screwing you? And as soon as she sees it, she's like, oh, my God, you're right. Let's just fix it. But.  \nMe: Let's. Just fix it. So what's been done to try and fix it already?  \nThem: Well, one, doing the positioning and aligning on what is it that we sell and what within the discipline do we fundamentally do differently? That is a differentiator. And what are the combinations of those things that we package. Right. That are already in place on other pieces of business that are easy to say. Great. Add more to this grouping of things we have.  \nMe: What? Is it that we sell? And what is in the. Discipline. Doing fundamentally. Do differently. That it's different. In. Order to combination. Of those things. That we have. Right. That are already. In place. Another. Piece of business. That are. Great. Like. We're saying that. Things we have.  \nThem: So Joanna and I did that in the past three months. So Stephen went down to Houston, met with the growth team, and said, guys,  \nMe: To deal. With. Having three. Hundred. One. With the. Growth.  \nThem: This is now what we are selling. These are the parameters of the product. And now they're starting to understand it because they're like, oh, this is so cool. We had no idea.  \nMe: Of your. Self. Yeah.  \nThem: They just thought you say yes because you're an agency that can do it all. So that's part of it. So I think they understand it. Do they believe it? Time's gonna tell. The biggest issue is they don't have the relationship.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: So my main concern is, like, I'm like, why are we chasing this garage door opener company in Chicago?  \nMe: Why? Are we chasing? This one.  \nThem: That is. Like $100,000 in creative fee.  \nMe: Hundred. Thousand dollars.  \nThem: But is gonna cost us, like, $300,000 in people to staff. Right? And I was like,  \nMe: Who's the cfo here? Who's doing.  \nThem: Michael Diacino is the cfo and he is legacy. Mmi. But he's like, kim, what the fuck's going on here? The bottom's falling out on this thing between you and I, Stagwell is now stepping in and babysitting him because they're like, where is this off?  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: That I'm in. Sam is like, I go this management meeting the other day, and I said, if nobody skip tracking our organic growth and nobody's tracking our new business growth,  \nMe: Yeah. And. Nobody's tracking. Our business. Brick.  \nThem: Against what we actually have in place and what we can service.  \nMe: But. Yes. It? Absolutely. Happens. But.  \nThem: We're fucking ourselves. We're gonna hurry up and we're take ten hundred thousand dollars clients instead of one one million dollars client. Right. So the problem is Stagwell doesn't see that we can do this, so they're piecemealing us very small. Piecemeal things, and they don't get very good things to begin with. They're gonna choose something for you. Like, Juliana and I were out the other night. She's like, yeah. They just said, here's Cadillac. And she's like, as great as that is, that's not the work we wanna be doing. But we take it. Because they're like, you need to take. Cattle.  \nMe: It. 's not. Well. But that's the type of thing that would be perfect for you guys at Christian, right? I don't want you to be playing second fiddle to a friend of yours, but equally, it's like,  \nThem: Correct. No. We do what we do until we have proof.  \nMe: No, I get it. I get it. Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah, I don't even think about that. I'm just being like, if we can't stand the thing up and we have all of these small clients and we can't be profitable, then why on earth would they hand us something bigger?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Why on earth would Consultant come to us and see all of this? Piecemeal stuff we're doing. And say, oh, you guys should totally go and sit at the table on, like, a McDonald's pitch, right? So there's just a lack of understanding about how you kind of have to.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Prove that you can do it before you have the thing to do it. So we're showing up to was great. Like, great. The people are like. The creative work is phenomenal. We are happy. They are psyched. It's all the other pieces that they're like. That's your lead account person. So we have somebody that's like a Southern debutant who went and got flowers for the room and wants to make sure everything's nice, but has done no research on the business to sit at the table. Right? So call it like the favorite. Nice syndrome, if you will. Like, everybody's busy showing up, trying. To be like, hey, businessman, like, so funny. I'm so charming. I know enough to get a pat on the head. But they're not coming to the table ready to play.  \nMe: Right? Yeah. Yeah. No. I totally get that. What's the name of your CMO again? Steve.  \nThem: Steven bonsignore.  \nMe: Stephen. Feels like Stephen needs somebody underneath him that he can just help kind of manage mental closely, who can then be almost like this human to prove to Maggie. That altogether. We are. You know, we're stronger in this dynamic. Anyway. Sorry.  \nThem: So nobody on the growth team is managing the product that we are. We had to explain to them what the product is. That's fine. I'll tell you what it is that I need to sell X, Y, and Z. In fact, I kind of love being in that scenario. To be, like, cool, I get to decide. It's extraordinary, challenging. So right now, growth is our biggest issues. So when we had that conversation, And, I mean, we were both there for it. I want to discuss our separate realities. Did it sound like she was asking you to be the growth person or to find the growth person?  \nMe: There was a mix. I think there were two briefs with Maggie. So one that was ahead of head of new business or some business. New business. Development person. But then there was also the additional brief of can you help us get introduced to brands via your own network? And there would be some sort of kickback from that. For example, if I introduced you to a tech brand and you've got a million, they would be a kickback of some sort for unknown. But that was the other way. So I would love to do that, but unfortunately, we're at a point where 80% of our clients are agencies. So at some point, we would love to become an intermediary, and I think it's a very smart play, but it's going to take a few years before we get to that point. Yeah.  \nThem: Because I was a little confused in that conversation. I was like, are you asking Sam for the growth person, or are you asking Sam to be the growth person? So you heard both.  \nMe: 100% both. I wasn't expecting it to say that because it's something like loosely, we had discussed when we first got introduced. But it never kind of came through to anything, to be honest. What I find fascinating, though, is I'm sure if Stephen really had kind of his hands around the entire team, you'd generate quite a lot of leads if you were doing it in a smart way. And I'm sure you get yourself into some really, really interesting runes. It feels like very disjointed. And from Maggie. I love Maggie, but perhaps managing up to Stagwell, which is, I can imagine, really, really hard. There is this moment where you're like, okay, well, we need this person. We need this person to be the middleman or the middlewoman. And help us just elevate our business development, I guess. Yeah, sorry.  \nThem: So. A person in the growth position in my mind needs to understand strategically what it is that we do. What is like the fundamental differentiator in. Otherwise, you know, an in house team would just hire all the bits and pieces and be conducted by a CMO or a creative director. But like, what is the strategic business approach. That is unique to Crispin to be able to one sell that, hone that be partnering with consultants to be like, is this package premium? How do we need to repackage to get in the room on these things? Right? Manning that relationship and then also going out and saying, you know what, I'm gonna call up this person. I'm gonna cold call them. I'm go get drinks with them. Between you and I, the woman that she's in Houston, she goes on vacation once a month to go to Disneyland with her husband.  \nMe: Yes. Y. Es. Y. Es. Y. Es.  \nThem: But.  \nMe: How old is she? Sir.  \nThem: She's like a giant baby. She's like, I don't know, 40.  \nMe: Sorry.  \nThem: I know. I'm just like.  \nMe: Completely.  \nThem: I'm into it in a reality TV kind of level, but then my reality day to day is, like, punching the air because I'm, like, so mad. I don't want to see your picture with Chewbacca. I just want to fucking know what we're doing this week.  \nMe: Are you rating us? Disneyland. This is a long play. Like, what's the whole thing?  \nThem: Yeah. Does Chewbacca have $2 million for us, please?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Tell me. Sorry. I shouldn't make fun. But it's hard not to because you're like, what are we doing?  \nMe: This is a circle of trust. I totally see you.  \nThem: So we fundamentally knows it. At her core, Maggie knows something's off, but she needs help. Being like this is what you need in this person. So I was thinking that you and I could both start to explain to her what it is you specifically need and growth people. Because she's like, Stephen, you tell me now. As smart as Stephen is. Ivy League man, go getter. Hard worker.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Like all the good things he doesn't know what he doesn't know.  \nMe: On.  \nThem: That doesn't mean he should leave. But why are we waiting? For somebody who doesn't quite know to figure it out, right? It's like a case of, like, in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king.  \nMe: Right. Yeah.  \nThem: So he's got one eye. She's like, we've got a winner. And I'm like, what if. Bet he had two eyes?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: It's not about dethroning him, but what happens when we get somebody that fundamentally understands what the business is when you think about mischief. Not that I want to model them. Ollie, who they wound up putting in the growth position, came from a PR background within Adweek. Right. So he understood the business as a whole. He understood what the competitiveness was between the agency. So he could be. Because he's savvy enough to be like, well, I know what everybody else's product is, therefore my product needs to be this in order to get a little further ahead.  \nMe: Yeah. That's interesting.  \nThem: Should I be deciding what the product is at this stage? Yes. Given where we're at, should I have somebody in a position that's like, I think we need to look about at scaling this portion of our company? In order to get us one client at a million dollars versus 10 at 100,000. Right. So Michael, our CFO, understands what the problem is.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: He's 35 years old. He's been the CFO for, like, five years. No shade on anybody that's younger. If you're smart, you're smart. But saying he sees the problem, but he doesn't know quite how to fix it, and he doesn't know how to say this. Is what I need. So again, Joanna and I are bringing him in, being like, can you crunch the numbers on what this is doing right now versus what this is doing?  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: I have the whole C suite. Do an aim plan of their growth for next year. Like what is the bare minimum we need, what is the ideal to grow to and what is the middle ground? How much do all three of these things cost? And how do we arm Maggie?  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: With the words to go in. She'll go get it for us from Stagwell.  \nMe: Es. Yes.  \nThem: But we're making that up.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Based on not having the product quite right and not being able to deliver on the day to day work we're selling. Then what's the point in doing that, right? So I'm like, maggie, I love this. Let's hurry up and get to Stagwell for 2026. But what's your three year plan?  \nMe: What is the point? Of doing that.  \nThem: So again, I'm being very transparent. These are the things I've uncovered. I think they make sense. Please forgive me if I'm wrong in explaining. What? I'm new to seeing all this, but I understand how systems work, so I'm like, okay.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: I can balance a checkbook that doesn't. The math doesn't work.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: That was, like, the most Gen X thing I could have said. Balance a checkbook. Sam. Let's take a minute.  \nMe: In fact.  \nThem: I'm going to follow up by mailing you a letter after this. Oh, my God. Sorry. I understand.  \nMe: No, I get it.  \nThem: How, but because I understand how to balance a checkbook. Perhaps that it's why I understand. Where's all the stuff coming from? I don't have it automatically being tallied for me in a way that's like, green is good. Red is bad. So the growth scenario, I think is one defining what is a good growth person look like? What is the job description?  \nMe: Y. Es. Y. Es. Yep.  \nThem: Right. Because even, I mean, obviously you're not going to bring somebody who doesn't understand what it is. But you also need to explain to this person this is the unique challenge outside of fundamentally understanding what the job is.  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: Do you have it in you? To make this right. Like we talked at Click for me, because I was like, this seems fucked up. I'll throw my hat in the ring. Let's try it. Because it's interesting. Is there somebody that's entrepreneurial enough in that mindset to say, like, I'd really love to come in. And help make this work.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Yeah. I've learned this when we. When I was talking to you and Maggie, it sounded like you wanted literally just a hunter who could just go and gather leads. And bring them in, which is part of the role. But. Having you say this in more detail, it sounds like you actually need somebody that's able to come in, partner with the right people internally at a very senior level and go, that's not right. That's not working. These guys don't actually understand how to sell things. They've got their head in. The sand and kind of ignoring bigger briefs. We've got some really interesting opportunities here. Why the hell have we got two projects at 200, 300k a year when we should be going after the bigger piece, which might take a little bit longer, but that type of thing.  \nThem: So the issue is, and the reason she's saying hunter now is because I was politely trying to describe the difference between a cook, a chef, a hunter, a gatherer, Right? And I was like, so the woman now, Caitlyn, she's like the loveliest person.  \nMe: The difference? Between. Yeah.  \nThem: I heard she's friends with Chewbacca. She is good at gathering all the stuff. But then she looks at it and she can't tell the difference. She's just like, well, we have to make this number at the end of the year. So when Maggie goes and tells.  \nMe: Can I just. Can I have the. What part of a brief does she not kind of get? Like, I just need, like, an example.  \nThem: I think she doesn't understand the larger revenue model. Like, what is the business we're in? Scaling does not mean just getting more, and we'll figure it out later. Scaling means we actually can take this in. Because we have a model that can support it. Therefore, the profitability, even if it is 100 grand, is like, we can make 60 grand off this and do it in our sleep by just.  \nMe: Even. If it is under a. High. Sleep. By just.  \nThem: Adding 50% more of one person to something there's no understanding of the larger system of when.  \nMe: I think. 50% more. One person. There are no. Understanding. Of the larger. System.  \nThem: An RFP comes in. One, is this RFP worth our time against what our offering is and what we want to be known for. Two, is what it's going to take to staff. This even worth the money? Then she's going in and she's doing scoping.  \nMe: Yes. Yes.  \nThem: Scoping against not understanding what all the roles do, who you need to do it.  \nMe: Y. Es. Yes. Yes. Y.  \nThem: You know, it's like, well, we can cut corners and do this, and look, I got the money, so we got to the revenue, but she doesn't understand the ripple effect.  \nMe: Es. Y. Es. Y. Es. Y. Ep.  \nThem: She shouldn't be in charge of the rainforest. You know what I mean? She doesn't understand how each part sort of affects another in order to lift it up.  \nMe: Do you think it's because she does come from that kind of most influence performance marketing world?  \nThem: She just doesn't have the background. And I think if she even knew what it was, would she be the right person to do it? She thought somebody. I think she's like, this is fun. I'm in charge of something and I get paid a lot of money and I can live my good life. Is she somebody That's.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Like this is what I really want to be doing.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So it's a casting issue in talent and then also personality type. So if somebody doesn't seem serious and I'm like, oh, Caitlin from.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: Crispin, and I go to her feed, and I see this giant baby at Disney. And I'm like, somebody that has a corporation that I want to go and work with these people. I don't know that I want to call the giant baby and talk about numbers. You want somebody?  \nMe: Because I presume that's what you're going to have this person on calls with CMOs and you know, the key decision makers, and you have to be in a room asking smart questions to unpack the. Right, yeah.  \nThem: Does the part of playing the role, but, like, calling from, like, a gaming room that's filled with, like, 90 Laboos, and, like, I think, to me, it's just, like, it's not cheap. Like, I would not show up to the party wearing that outfit ever.  \nMe: Sorry. She's not still at Disneyland. She's back at home.  \nThem: She's at home in the Laboo throne. So I think this is the issue is like one.  \nMe: The picture is thrown.  \nThem: If baggy. I have a feeling I have no proof if Maggie's not being taken as seriously as she could, but she's in a room with all these old white dudes at Stagwell that are like, well, she's interesting because she talks the talk and she's young and she's a gun. If I am a cmo of a brand or a CEO, and I see the CEO, and I'm like, whoa, she's interesting.  \nMe: And. I see the scene. Ry.  \nThem: And she's got, like, three Ferraris in the garage behind her. I take her a lot more seriously than being like, if you go to clicks deep and you're like,  \nMe: And. She's got. Three moderators. Around. There. I take. Her away. For a series. 100%.  \nThem: Oh.  \nMe: It's a bloody great analogy.  \nThem: So there's just sort of like.  \nMe: Perception thing. Right. And what I think the problem here is that the first. She's not. She might look at a Ferrari in yourself. But then the other people are perhaps not quite. Fast enough and yeah, yeah.  \nThem: So that was the problem. We went into the pitch on Whataburger. It was for 11 million. The strategy was not very good. But we went in the work for the tissue. Was fire. Three campaigns fully flushed. Like, I was just like, fuck it. Let's just make the campaigns like, these ideas are good. They're elastic, they're weird.  \nMe: Good. They're elastic. Clear.  \nThem: Broaden the whole thing against the model that we're offering. Maggie was like, this is the best work we've ever had. This is the most exciting thing we get in the room.  \nMe: Like. Models that were. Operated back into. That. Work. You never have. It. This is the. Most exciting thing.  \nThem: Wrong count. Person in the room. Wrong strategy. Person in the room.  \nMe: Your side, Christian side.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Why? Why?  \nThem: Because who we had.  \nMe: Maggie wasn't in there, or no, he wasn't.  \nThem: Maggie was in there and Joanna was in there. But Joanna was new and sort of trying to play 30,000ft watching, and she saw it unfolding. But essentially these clients were saying they wanted one thing.  \nMe: Fire. D.  \nThem: But the way they were reacting was saying another. So I was asking them, being like, hey, I'm doing it nicely. But nobody was backing me up. So the consultant, when we were done, David. I'm forgetting his name. He's like an old school omnicom dude.  \nMe: But the point. They were bringing. Up. Doing? It that way. But nobody's back. Ing him.  \nThem: He pulls me aside. He was like, that was extremely well done. And he's like, not a complimentary or a nice man. And then he called after and he said, okay, it's a hard no. They're pulling out. You had a Ferrari in the room. And you didn't know how to drive it. And that was also Joanna. They were like, you didn't let Joanna show up. Your account person knew nothing about these people's business and she was going to be the day to day lead and she did nothing to forge that relationship. And your strategy was so fundamentally bland and had no understanding of what the business need was against, where it needed to go, that you had all of this great work.  \nMe: Like. What do they. Have.  \nThem: But it fundamentally wasn't laddering back to understanding of who they are as a brand and what they need to move forward.  \nMe: Yes. Would that have been Joanna's job? Sorry? Had she been at.  \nThem: Joanna.  \nMe: Because in she like the csr, essentially, no.  \nThem: No, it's very vague. We have a head of strategy.  \nMe: Yes, remind me.  \nThem: And Joana is overseeing strategy, but she's also given.  \nMe: I remember now. She's the one who threw her arms up and was like, they don't know what they're talking about.  \nThem: Juliana. Yeah.  \nMe: Yes, you know.  \nThem: Julia. Joanna also inherited account services, and Maggie said, I think it's pretty clear I shouldn't be in charge of the account people. So she's been trying to solve the account problem.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And we've had a head of strategy that has been promised CSO before Joanna got there. That really probably seemed cool to the people who didn't know better, but maybe right now.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Is more like, oh, I inherited this fucked up thing. Like, yes, she can do the work, but she fundamentally doesn't want to do the part of turning the Titanic.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You know what it means to the castings off there. And so it's fine. She's good, but she's so overextended, she hired a freelancer to come in and do the strategy.  \nMe: Yeah, okay.  \nThem: And I'm starting to be like, I'm the person that has to unlock strategy for everybody all the time. And on this, I was like, I'm just gonna go do the work. You have to figure out your strategy. I know what to do to do the work. And it bit us. But I've also. Like? Well, eleven million dollar wheel popped off the cart. That's nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to them, that's a huge deal.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So, like, I think this is like, again, if we don't have Joanna and I can handle getting the account and the strategy and the creative people to a place right now that is operating above where we were, but if we don't have somebody guiding us from, like, that outside perspective and how we sell ourselves and it's not just pr. It's what is the package? Against what is profitable, against what I know is going to help us.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: That's the thing. So Stephen understands it because I've basically shaken the baby for three months and been like, dude. Play this out. That Tangare project sounds really cool.  \nMe: Seven.  \nThem: It's going to be $40,000 in revenue. And the way you guys are scoping it right now, we're going to spend $300,000 to get that $40,000 in.  \nMe: To. Get that story. Yeah.  \nThem: He's like, but this is the kind of client we want. I'm like, theoretically. Now, if we had something that was already up and running and it was a machine and that came in and it was like a cute portfolio piece to help scale us into liquor,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And we saw the return on investment, then we would take it.  \nMe: What is it? What is the breath? What? What is the tanker? A Brit. Is it like a social influencer thing?  \nThem: What? The ten gray thing. It was social, but I'm like, no, you need 10 tangare. You need the entire Diageo portfolio. You don't need one piece of it.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So. It's like we're getting our foot in the door on things, but we're not profitable on the day to day. To just be like, hey, if we did that Tengare project, and we did it killer, because I know we could, and make it look really chic. To scale us. We don't have the ability. To invest in doing something like that right now. So Stephen's getting us those things based on just his relationships, which is nice and great. But again, he doesn't understand. He's just starting to understand how it plugs into the larger picture.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay? And it's stephen, an mmi guy as well.  \nThem: Yeah. So Maggie actually hired him four years ago to be her personal PR person and thought leadership person, and he was freelance as a consultant.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And she brought him in in a part time capacity when she fired Liz Levy, who was CMO.  \nMe: Ok? Ay. Y. Ep.  \nThem: Because, again, not the right fit. He was playing interim, and he turned out to actually be quite good and quite a connector in the group. So she's now convinced him to come in in more of a full time role.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: He's not the wrong person right now. He's like, oh, I didn't have a visibility in how that actually affected Creative Kim because Steve couldn't tell him how what he was doing affected creative.  \nMe: Yes. Zero. Yeah. I mean.  \nThem: So we've got a better C suite now in regards to being like, do you understand when you do that what happens over here? Because I'm the person that goes, I have a question.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: I'm new here. When you say that, what does that mean for you? Cfo? And he's like, oh, well, it can mean one of two things. And I'm like, well, how do we get to the thing that we need it to mean? Well, we would need to do this. And I'm like, Cool. Are we clear on what we need to do to do that? I'm being a camp counselor.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Yeah, yeah. You're literally. It's like there's an element of this role that requires somebody to do that as well.  \nThem: So it's very weird, Sam. I don't think I should be doing that. But thank God somebody is, like, doing it and Joanna's starting to do it.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But Joanna the other day, said Kim, I feel like we're stuck holding the bag. And I said, no, I think it's worse than that. We are the bag. We are the bag.  \nMe: You need somebody into become the bag and not take it away from you guys.  \nThem: Control what's coming into the bag because I'll be the back of the stuff going in the bag is cool.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: I'll be like, I will be fully responsible for all of this stuff. Give it to me. But right now. We're like the barf bag.  \nMe: Yeah. A new. A new.  \nThem: I want to be like a chic gift bag.  \nMe: Yeah. I know that. I know what you mean.  \nThem: I'd like to be a designer. Gift bag.  \nMe: Yeah. Designer gift bag. Nice.  \nThem: Not airplane barf bag. Sorry.  \nMe: That rips easily. No, that won't happen, okay? So how I mean. How do we. How do we. Make this happen with Maggie. Like what? What. What do we need to do? Do you need help pulling a brief together? Do you need me to.  \nThem: I. Think. Yeah. I think we need to get it on paper and say, hey, there's a couple things. We talked about this, but when you think about this, that's really only one portion of what this role probably needs to be doing.  \nMe: Write. Yeah.  \nThem: Connect it back to the agency and profitability, and I can help.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: With that in that capacity, but understanding that we probably need to invest in something a little bit different, like, you know, you came for the entry level model, and maybe you need the family size extended vehicle, whatever.  \nMe: Yes. Yes.  \nThem: Width. You need the leather seats in this.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You know, and what that return on investment could look like. Against, you know, instead of getting so what this means. Because you could say, hey, based on, you know, where you're at now, it seems like you have a lot of smaller clients that have lower revenue. In order to think about longevity and profitability and how this role plays an integral role in that. How do you get in the room for the larger Meteor clients? That allow you? To truly be a challenger agency. So, like, you know, and I think we said this, and I didn't say it because she gets nervous when I say it, but it's true. She wants to be a challenger agency for Challenger brands. And I said, Sam, that means one of two things. That means either we are fundamentally challenging the status quo of what's happening in the industry. So when we need somebody who actually knows what's going on outside of Houston,  \nMe: Y. Eah. Yes. Going. On in. Psychology.  \nThem: I do. Joanna does. Some people do. But, like, in order to do that, we need to know what the status quo is, and we need enough revenue and space to try out different things, to figure out what to stand up.  \nMe: What? You stand up.  \nThem: Right now, we're just, like, playing in the kitchen, and, like, the cook wants to be a chef, and it's not coming together.  \nMe: Right. Now. Come. Together.  \nThem: So I think we just need to lay out like this is what the role is in order to think of not the short term getting you more clients, but the right clients and the right standing within the industry. So the other thing for Challenger Agency, for Challenger Brands, right? So there's people who challenge the status quo for brands that want to challenge status quo or you're a second rate agency for second rate brands and right now are the second.  \nMe: Right. People. Challenge. Them both brand. On. Want a child? Or. Second grade. Second grade. Yeah. Yeah. You want to be the first?  \nThem: Yeah. And she's like, don't say the second thing. And I was like, well, you need to say it. You need to acknowledge what it is.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And then we need to manifest the other thing by knowing what we're moving away from. So I would say, She mentioned Challenger Agency for Challenger Brands. I'm going to PDF a version of our positioning. And I'm going to send you, and that's.  \nMe: Please do. Yeah.  \nThem: I'm going to send that to you just so you can see how it's stacking up. What we're talking about doing. It's going to seem a little 101 for agency in some regard, but remember. It's everybody's first day on Earth from Houston, so it seems very baseline. But essentially, I think if the job description can kind of track towards what we need to do and go from being. King of 300 shitty brands to king of three pretty cool brands.  \nMe: Three. Hundred fifty grand. Yeah. Y. Eah. Maybe that. Maybe that is the brief. Okay?  \nThem: That is brief. The person that can drive you from that. Here's what that takes. It's not just a hunter with relationships. It's a person that fundamentally understands your business, understands the product you're selling and how to scale that.  \nMe: Yeah. Understand. The problem. You're selling. And. How scale. Now.  \nThem: In a way that grows your business, right? And then also grows you within the Stagwall network.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Y. Eah.  \nThem: Cool.  \nMe: Okay? Yeah.  \nThem: That was a lot of information. I'm sorry for the bloodletting, but I was like, let me just tell you what it is that's happening.  \nMe: No, thank you. That's. That's really, really useful for me to know, and. One thing's for sure. I want to make something work. I know that budgets are tight. All of this stuff as well. Like I think Maggie is how we work. Previously on the the ECD search that. I was also on the the strategy search as well. I was before you hired that person from jl.  \nThem: Two.  \nMe: There was somebody else really, really good that I was really hoping that they would hire to work alongside you, who I just thought was, like, awesome. I remember.  \nThem: Thousand.  \nMe: That.  \nThem: Jody coppernel.  \nMe: Yeah. There. Do you know her? Did we talk about her? Fuck's sake. Yeah, of course.  \nThem: L.  \nMe: I remember. Sorry.  \nThem: She? Was the right person.  \nMe: Yeah, I know. I don't know what happened. Yeah, of course. Sorry, kim. Long time.  \nThem: No. I thought I, in fact, was like, hey, talk to her, because she would be perfect. You should bring her in. Staggle is pushing back. Maggie was like, kim, you were an anomaly. Like I can't believe I got you through, but I still think that's bullshit because.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: We make reality.  \nMe: No, no. And it was worth the investment for sure. And this will be as well. I'm just wondering, like, is there a way. How do I articulate that to be like, what happens if. This doesn't go through what breaks, you know?  \nThem: Like, what does it mean for you not to get this growth person or for me to do this work for you and you not be able to follow through on the hire?  \nMe: Follow. The truth. On the plan.  \nThem: Or both.  \nMe: E move the former to be honest.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: I mean. Yeah. Look, the dynamic of how an unknown will work with Crispin might have to change. To be honest, it's like. Like anything.  \nThem: I don't want errand for you. I know we all pitch things and have to take losses, but there's got to be a search fee at least.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's. That's why I suggest. I mean, that's what I was suggesting, and it could be a reduced one. To just engage and go, yo, let's just make this happen quickly. We can get this through the door and we can have this person in. By the new year or, you know, early, early next year, we can start kind of progressing quickly. And then from there, it's the kind of, I don't know, hopefully opens up wider things and you have to grow the. Grow the entire team. But. Yeah, you are right. There would have to be a search fee. But I wouldn't. I wouldn't be like. It would be custom to what? Maggie and I can be flexible around that, to be honest.  \nThem: Sure. I know, but I just want you paid. Like, let's just.  \nMe: Because. No, I appreciate that.  \nThem: Creative person like you need to get paid for the thing that you do.  \nMe: Yeah, I appreciate that. And I. I do appreciate you, like, getting that as well. And I think. I think Maggie does as well. I think she's just a bit like. I don't know, she must be looking at the numbers or something and going, I don't know if we can afford, like. 30.  \nThem: Understand the difference. So she's like, why would I pay for this? I don't understand the value in it. So if we can put together like this is what it means.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: It would take for this role. These are the numbers you're looking at in somebody like that.  \nMe: Yep. Okay?  \nThem: Could be somebody kind of new to the game. But also has the experience. Like I look at Ollie. They made him up.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: He never did that before. It's finding the person fundamentally understands how to do that.  \nMe: Yeah. That's a really interesting hire as well. By the way. It's so cool.  \nThem: It was.  \nMe: Very interesting.  \nThem: Because there was somebody that fundamentally understood. So if we are going at it in a challenger way, And I think this is what Maggie thinks she does a lot of the time. Like, I'm going to take somebody that's a challenger because they did something different and they're going to become this thing. You have to be able to critically evaluate what their skill set is and understand if they know how to synthesize it into doing the job description. But if there's never a job description,  \nMe: What? Skill set. Yes.  \nThem: And you're just like, wow, this person has all this cool knowledge I know nothing about. And then you roll the dice. So you're like, wow, I bought. You know, I bought enough $50 sweaters. They're not that nice. I'm going to go back to $20 sweaters. And you're like, yeah, but have you ever bought a $300 sweater because you only have one for the rest of your life. Sorry, I'm using so many metaphors. This morning.  \nMe: Yeah. No, I love it. I love an analogy. I love a metaphor. Keeping them.  \nThem: But do you know what I mean? It's just like if she doesn't know the difference, then she's going to go back to what she knew before. And I think we all do that. And I've been reminding her, I'm like, well, comfort's a slow death.  \nMe: Over. And I. Think we all do that. Y. Eah.  \nThem: So where's that getting us?  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: So I think again. Once I put stuff on paper for her and she sees it. I brought her through a positioning last night for a client that we have people out, so we're going to get on a call in 13 minutes.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: About? Oh. Once she sees it. She gets it.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: She doesn't know what she isn't getting right now.  \nMe: I'll help you write this job description to help create that level of value. But how does she just granularly. How does she digest information?  \nThem: Okay? She? 's a visual person, like a one pager.  \nMe: Okay? Okay?  \nThem: Let's get it on paper and I can think about how to visualize it for her. You just have to step it out.  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: Because once I'll send you the positioning I basically was.  \nMe: Yes, send me that, and then I can pull something together.  \nThem: Like when you think about a creative brief. She digests things that way. Here's the state of the industry. Here's what I'm understanding about looking at your business from the outside. And then let's think about what is the immediate goal and what is the long term goal. So, based off of what you asked for,  \nMe: And. Then let's think about what. The. Ppx. Global product. Is. What you ask for.  \nThem: How does that serve the immediate goal, but not the long term goal? Based off of what I think, when we zoom out of this and we think about what that Challenger role could be,  \nMe: How. To preserve. What? I take. For me. Like, zoom out. We think about, like, What? That. Sounds.  \nThem: How does that get you? From a to m instead of a to b.  \nMe: Yes. Yes. How did you. How did you put it? Like, so succinctly. You said you want to be the Challenger agency for Challenger Brands, but right now we're playing Tier two. It's, like, weird.  \nThem: We could challenge the status quo with people that want to challenge the status quo and get interesting work and be known for something. Or we could do second rate work per second rate brands.  \nMe: And we. Know for something. To. Separate part for. Set. Great. Yeah. And she didn't like it when you say that.  \nThem: No, because it's true.  \nMe: Yeah, totally. But you can't. You're not going to be able to get out of that until you hire this person. It feels like this is why she's focused on this. Interesting. Yeah.  \nThem: She used the language of Challenger Agency for Challenger Brands. She thinks she explained it to you clearly. So we can use that as being like that. And I can send you the paperwork so you know what it means every time you vet it to be like.  \nMe: So. We can get. Back to being. Like.  \nThem: Is that the act of listening that she needs to get her to make the decision, or is she going to know that we were basically being like, cool Maggie? Here's her script. Now say yes.  \nMe: The. Active listening. That we need. To get her to be. Done. We were al. Ike. Basically. Like, full. Max yearly tricks. Now.  \nThem: It's also open to at times because she asks for it.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Listen, I really do like her. I think. You don't have to tell her things twice.  \nMe: Great.  \nThem: Struggling because she doesn't have the people to support in that capacity.  \nMe: Yeah. We've got to find a grown up somebody who as an entrepreneur, but in this creative space, but that is equally like kind of semi consultant in a way that can kind of pull things together.  \nThem: Correct.  \nMe: And I think that. I think there are people. There will be people out there and people who are up for that challenge. I do think you need somebody in the building. Who has that kind of. Dare I say, kind of new york. Kind of just way of hustle and kind of smart. Not somebody that. 's based in Houston. For example, you need somebody with a high level, like caliber. Who can really help push the team to new heights, along with you and Joanna. Because I feel like together, you're going to be that ultimate trio. Okay? All right, so just to confirm, Kim, you need me. I know you. I'll let you dash in a second, but next steps, you're going to send me the kind of what Krispin is about now in a PDF. I'm going to.  \nThem: Yes. Hold on. I can tell you around what window I will send that it will be today.  \nMe: Send that. Great.  \nThem: I know your hours ahead there. And I can text as many I did like. I'll help you do this. Worry about holiday time on our end.  \nMe: I know. It's cool. You've got Thanksgiving around the corner, and you're doing much for it.  \nThem: Celebrate all of the things that we stole from people of color. It'll be great.  \nMe: Oh. Dear.  \nThem: No, we're going up to Boston. We're chilling. Want to see some friends? Okay.  \nMe: Nice.  \nThem: Time? Around 12:30 today. So noonish my time. I'll send it through so by evening.  \nMe: Ping. It.  \nThem: You'll have. And I can also summarize what I think the way to explain it to her will be. I know you took but.  \nMe: Yeah, you have it. Great. Okay. Y. Es. Yeah, I've got lots of notes.  \nThem: Just take a minute to what I'm saying down on paper. Is it tracking? And I'll send that to you. I'm going to send it from my Gmail. I'm just going to go that route.  \nMe: Right. Isn't that lovely? Cool. And then I'll pull kind of a rough kind of job description together with an explanation of Kalim why. Just in a kind of short couple of paragraphs as well.  \nThem: Send it back to me and her because we spoke to you. I can link it to the COO and to Joanna, because then it'll be like, goddamn right, that's what we need.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay, go ahead. Yeah.  \nThem: And she trusts us.  \nMe: She doesn't know they're talking, though, does she?  \nThem: Myself or fire together like, we have made massive change very quickly.  \nMe: Awesome. I'll send that back to you. As well. But they don't know. Excuse me? They don't know that we're talking. I presume Maggie doesn't know that we're talking. There. Doesn't matter.  \nThem: No, I just decided to have a talk with you and be like, let me tell you what I actually know.  \nMe: Great.  \nThem: Because again, I want you to bring her stuff.  \nMe: This is really helpful.  \nThem: That she's going to sit on because she's unsure of the value in it.  \nMe: In it. I want you to.  \nThem: I want you to be like, here's the value. It's a shitter. Get off the pop moment, right?  \nMe: Be like, hear the. Value. It's a shiver. Yeah. Yeah, 100%.  \nThem: And then either you're going to engage in the search and you're going to get paid for what you do, or we're going to stay in this gray area for, like, another 18 months and nothing's going to happen.  \nMe: Going to. Happen except.  \nThem: Except the agency will crumple.  \nMe: They. 'll come. Yeah.  \nThem: Again, I think. Yeah, Just strategizing. What's the best way forward? Let's see if we can move the needle. It's better than that abstract call we had where I was like, did she said two things. Was she asking for one or was she asking for both?  \nMe: Do. Any other question I have is when I send something back to her, do you need me to put something down and how much? Like a proposal from myself as well, and the costing? Or you just want kind of what we discussed in more detail.  \nThem: No. I can dip your toe in the pool.  \nMe: Great.  \nThem: And see if she bites and then just be like, okay, that's what that's going to cost.  \nMe: Got you. Okay, cool.  \nThem: Get her excited about the $300 sweater.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You're like, but in Today's World, the $300 sweater is kind of not that nice anymore. Let's just be.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's kind of cool to have a $10 one from a thrift shop, but, hey. It's cool. That's fine.  \nThem: Well, sometimes you can get, like, an $800 sweater for $10 sweater at a thrift shop. And we are in that reality right now. All the agencies are shedding humans.  \nMe: Well. We're. In that. Got it. That's true. That's true. That's true.  \nThem: We could get something nice at the thrift.  \nMe: I left that conversation. I'll have that conversation with Maggie.  \nThem: We don't know what. We don't know what nice is. Does it even matter?  \nMe: But there are still people shopping.  \nThem: All right.  \nMe: At the main store as well.  \nThem: Yeah, because they think they have money. Which I think is how we were shopping. We were like, oh, my God.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I made $10. Let me go and spend 50. And you're like, no, dummy.  \nMe: No.  \nThem: That doesn't work.  \nMe: No.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Time this morning.  \nMe: Well, it was a pleasure. Thank you, Kim. Really nice to catch up. And, yeah, I've taken a lot down. I'm just going to kind of digest it and I'll wait for your. Your email. But.  \nThem: Yeah, Just give me a couple hours. I got to go sell this thing in right now.  \nMe: Cool. All right. We'll go back. To luck. Go smash it. Cheers.  \nThem: Thanks.  \nMe: Bye."
