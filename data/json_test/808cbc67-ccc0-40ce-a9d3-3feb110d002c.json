  "full_transcript": "Me: Jack. I just messaged eggs and said sh. Pretend like we're in episode of Made in Chelsea later. He has a reply. Do you want? Coffee. I'm just about to join this call, and then I can grind. I think there's some coffee beans on the side. Yeah, you just need to scrawl the beans. Okay. Thanks, babe. Wait. Where's the bean grinders? Already should be in. On the left. Like near the big window where the coffee. Yeah. Cool. Fuck yev. Back. Here. Hey. O. H. Hello?  \nThem: Hello? Hello?  \nMe: How. Are you?  \nThem: All good. And you?  \nMe: I'm good, but I'm sad. I'm. Sad. I spoke tiffany.  \nThem: Reality being reality.  \nMe: I know. The truth hurts, man. The truth. Hurts. Yeah. I just got off the phone with her, and she was like, It's just like. It's just not right. You know what I mean? It's just not like if I felt like. There was a chance that this could work, I would have gone a bit harder, but she's just like, it's not the right size. Two, three years ago, I would have been so up for it. And I know that it's gonna take a lot and a lot of building, which three years ago, I would absolutely want to do. But right now, I want to walk into business that has team set up, that's working with big budgets, that's far more established, and I was just like, no, Tiffany, no. So. Yeah, so annoying. But it is what it is, you know?  \nThem: She was great. She's great. She said a lot of. Right things.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Like interesting things. At the same time. You know when someone. And let's say if you think the same, you know when you meet someone and. It's the best at the very beginning.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: It has to be something there. Extra. That? I don't know yet.  \nMe: When I met her, I was. Like, what's the catch? You know what I mean? What's, like, it's a bit too good to be true. Like, I don't get it.  \nThem: Exactly.  \nMe: But.  \nThem: I agree. I mean, she's great, but at the same time, I think that it's one of those people that. Shines a lot when you first meet. Probably she can maintain that glow.  \nMe: Totally.  \nThem: Over.  \nMe: And I think. I think she would. I. I think she would be great. 100%. There's no doubt about that. But also, I. I don't know whether she. She's so confident and so capable and super personable and, like, would own a room. I'm sure she's really good at. Like, new business because she's so, like, forthcoming and confident, but also, like, really friendly and, like, she's a vibe. She's got, like, an interesting edge about her. She's clearly quite plugged into the creative space, like, but at the same time, I actually don't know. Like the stuff that she's expanded at mox. Has taken like a year and a half. You know, so, like, I don't actually think. I think this person is almost like slightly level below, but not in terms of like professionalism, more like someone who is maybe a little bit more junior, but actually way more connected to brands already and could like, expand business quicker. You know, I don't know whether she's. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, what she's done at Mox is great, but it's taken her a year and a half, you know what I mean?  \nThem: I mean, a year and a half. It's not a bad turnaround.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: To be honest. Because things are not that fast when you start from scratch. But, well.  \nMe: But that. That's. That's expanding. I know that MOX is positioning is difficult because it's so connected to Nike, but that's. That's expanding a business which has. It already has a really big name in London. Like she was to do that with this, I think it would be a lot harder for her. And she did say that she. Struggled with Mox because she had been working in publishers and she'd been working at Heist and Variety, which is obviously much bigger.  \nThem: She said that? She actually said that she was struggling or she struggled a bit and mocks. Because she was used. To, you know, big names that open doors automatically somehow.  \nMe: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  \nThem: Anyway. I don't want to be stuck too much. She said no, that's totally fine.  \nMe: Yeah, yeah.  \nThem: Let's keep on the good work. No.  \nMe: So. Lydia. I'm speaking to her at 4. And then that Elliot guy came back to me. Literally, just now. It was weird. Let me send you him. One text. Right.  \nThem: So I'm going to. Let me share my screen and we can do a few quicks.  \nMe: El. Liot.  \nThem: One thing that I liked about Tiffany that now I'm going to be looking for another candidates, is.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: Willing to represent a brand or to own a brand. Like, she told me about dropping an event being, you know, like, doing and investing time in things to actually make the brand grow. Also.  \nMe: It's a huge part of this, though, right? Like, it's your plans to become more of a brand, a pretty pinnacle in this role.  \nThem: Pretty cool.  \nMe: You know what I mean? So if people need to care about building a brand as well as working for a business, you know what I mean? Okay, let me go to our little sheet.  \nThem: Yeah. Where is it? Here. Yeah.  \nMe: So already interviewed. Tiffany's in there. Lydia, let me put Elliot. 's thingy.  \nThem: Tiffany, not now.  \nMe: Tiffany's a. Not now. Yeah. I mean, she said she was going to have a think. But I don't think. There's much point. I'm just trying to get Elliot's irl. Sorry, one sec. So. Yeah, I'm speaking to lydia. For 20 minutes who I think could be great. I think I want to get out of her. Spring Studios. I'm sure you know them. They're quite a long standing. More like Creative Ad Agency. They've been around for ages. They've got a big name. I want to know what she's actually done there in terms of achievements, new business, stuff like that. But she's also been at highest knob. She was actually MD at heist knob, I think, for a bit, which I didn't realize. So going to speak to her Tulips. Good. And then speaking to Ellie Stein tomorrow.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Lydia. Great, actually.  \nMe: Yeah, I think, like, the best. But let's see. Let's see what she's saying.  \nThem: You changed that very fast.  \nMe: I'm what?  \nThem: You changed that very fast.  \nMe: Yeah, well, I just think on paper, she looks good. But we'll see, we'll see, we'll see.  \nThem: I mean, I think that. If we are going to compare, I think that we are going to compare.  \nMe: Yeah. Oh, yeah.  \nThem: I think on paper, Lydia looks pretty solid in commercial growth and actual achievements as an md. You know, senior director Partnerships MD for almost two years. Well. Sounds good.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Keep coming. Sir. What is the phase?  \nMe: The face is a. It's a. It's kind of like dazed.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Busy in fashion magazine. A bit more sort of like sports. Sports street wear rather than like luxury.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: But really cool. In London, it's like. A pretty, like, reputable publisher, but they have a, they, they have the magazine, then they have a creative studio that sits, like, in the middle there, does a lot of brand work. So, yeah, it'd be interesting to know because I think places like the Face, like, they're small, but their reach is really big. And, like, they work with a lot of really interesting brands. So if she's been in somewhere like the Face, she would understand what it's like to build something small or. Like, be a part of, like, an agile team. So, yeah, I'll see what she's saying and then. What did you think about Elliot? I feel like I've. This is so bad. I feel like I'm.  \nThem: White.  \nMe: I'm judging, but I feel like he'll be way more like salesy. You know what I mean?  \nThem: Okay? Two things. My Internet so slow at the moment.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Why is this? Okay? One second. Sorry. Let me change the network. Okay? I think it's working better now.  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: Okay, ellie.  \nMe: Elliot? Yeah, I think he again. I'm just. Completely judging her, but I think he will be a lot more salesy given the roles he's been in before. Thank you so much. Yeah, he's a lot more business development focused, which, to be fair, is actually needed for this. I don't know much about the British Basketball League, but I will find out. I don't know. How what that brand looks like or how big they are, but. I will do some digging. So, yeah, speaking to him tomorrow. Speaking to four. And then I guess, worst case scenario. If they're another couple conversations that you can have early next week, that's fine, as long as we're starting to have seconds when you're here. You know what I mean?  \nThem: Yeah, that makes sense. Let's try. Well, let's see if we're lucky.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: At least Lydia going to H2. That would be nice.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And still. So should I move Polly to Not now, because she's been in no Answer for ages.  \nMe: Yeah, move her.  \nThem: Okay? So we have. Some that. Not now, because he moved twice.  \nMe: Not now, because. Yeah. He's just not picking up the phone. So he's probably not that committed. But if he comes back to me, I'll let you know. Alex Shaw, she. I'm waiting for her to book in a time to speak to me. She did come back to me. She just doesn't want to chat. But I'm waiting for her to let me know when. Alex.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Alex came back to say. Not now. He's been telling me get a message. Basically, he's doing really well on common. So he wants to stay, which is fine.  \nThem: Backward. Not now.  \nMe: So, yeah, I'll probably put a couple more people on there. I'm going to speak to Lydia shortly. If we can get a conversation. What's your diary like tomorrow? To speak to Lydia, if she's good, obviously.  \nThem: A bit tight. But I can do. I can do 9 uk. I can do. Move I can do. 01:30 uk.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: That's pretty much it.  \nMe: Okay, cool. So let's say Lydia is great.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: And let's say Ellie is great. And then we have like two more first stage conversations. One of those involves to a second out of. Like rob, natalia. Lydia. And. Natalie at kay, lydia and victoria. Do you feel like that's a strong shortlist, or do you feel like there's something that needs.  \nThem: I think that's a strong shortlist. But now it's. It's interesting because after every first meeting, I have a bit more of.  \nMe: Gauge? Yeah.  \nThem: An understanding. So I can see Rob still maintaining his position of strong.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I can see Natalia a bit less now.  \nMe: Yeah, I agree.  \nThem: But I have serious doubts about.  \nMe: You loved her.  \nThem: I mean, she was. She was great, but. Well, I think that she's still strong. And I think Victoria is an all.  \nMe: Do you think? Yeah. What? Just like, vibe.  \nThem: Let's see. State 2, Stage 2 is also to be a bit more committed. No, but let's see.  \nMe: I love the drama. Okay, cool. Yeah, I agree. I think. I don't know. I'd be interested to see how Natalia responds to questions like, help me. When you've bought in a piece of business, how much was it worth? Like, I don't. I don't know how she's gonna respond about that. And also, you can't. In the first stage, you can kind of. Be like, yeah, like, I bought in this piece of business. I expanded it from this to this. But then when you're being asked a direct question, which is like, how much was it worth? What was the top? Like, you can't really run away from it, you know what I mean?  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah, of course. I think that Tiffany also. Said a few things that will help me out. Adding a few questions.  \nMe: Good.  \nThem: For the rest, like. What I can say now is I really need someone. Very commercial.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Because.  \nMe: I think it's someone commercial, and I think it's someone who. Isn't on, like 100 day. I think they're like that, like, new business director level, like 80 to 100, maybe like a bit younger. Not like, I know it's not about age, but someone who, like, knows brands really, really well, has a bit of a scene in London, like, knows what the right. Brands are to connect you guys to and expand in London, but also is like a bit more of a sales. Salesy person, you know what I mean?  \nThem: Maybe that could be. That could be an option. It's always a mix. It depends on what we finally decide. Like someone with more. Trust build around his role and his experience or her experience. I don't know. We? What? What I'm 100% sure is that I cannot judge which they involve. That I have now because, for example, I thought Tiffany wasn't that good. On paper, for example.  \nMe: Oh, no, you can't.  \nThem: And now. So let's say, let's see, let's go for stage.  \nMe: Cool, cool, cool. Okay. I'll speak to Lydia now. I'll let you know what she's saying. I'll hopefully book her in tomorrow. If someone comes back to me like Alex Shaw, I'll try and get a call with her asap. Obviously, I just want to make sure that we're. Keeping momentum with everyone else. And we're entering a period of the year where if they don't come back to me in the next week, they're probably, like, not gonna come back. So that's fine. I will, like, chase the people that I can. And then on the questions and stuff, what I suggest. We do next week is we'll have a clear idea as to exactly who's in the frame. And there's gonna be some people who you'll need to elaborate different, like questions on, for example. Like, I think Natalia would need some more questioning around, like, her actual new business skills and like, what that would look like even if she hasn't done it before. Questions which can confidently reassure you that she has the ability, like the skill and the will to do it. So maybe we can just go through each person and then just, like, talk about which areas need more development than others, but that we can do that next week, that's fine.  \nThem: Okay? Yeah. I'll have a think.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Perfect. Thank you, ellie.  \nMe: Thanks. Ciao."
