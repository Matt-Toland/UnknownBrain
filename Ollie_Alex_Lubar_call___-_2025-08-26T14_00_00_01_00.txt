## Enhanced Notes
### Omnicom-Interpublic Merger Impact

- $1 billion in promised synergies between companies
  - Half from technology efficiencies
  - Half from headcount reductions
- Creating anxiety among talent - being told to â€œkeep heads downâ€
- Challenge: proving client value beyond just cost-cutting and complexity
- Leadership viewed as â€œshort-term financial managersâ€ rather than visionary
  - Quarterly-focused rather than 5-10 year outlook
  - Wonâ€™t invest in true integration despite long-term benefits

### Three Competing Messages Challenge

- Wall Street: Show immediate Q1 2026 upside
- Internal talent: Manage anxiety during restructuring
- Clients: Demonstrate enhanced value, not just consolidation
- Compensation structure needs overhaul for cross-selling incentives
  - Currently no mechanism rewarding cross-discipline collaboration
  - Industry historically poor at integrated compensation models

### Alexâ€™s Career Position

- Open to new opportunities but not other holding companies
- Sees next 2 years as â€œvery trickyâ€ for Omnicom
- Prefers smaller entities with best-in-class talent + foundational technology
- Has conversations with upstream consultancies looking to build out creative capabilities
- Compensation system at Omnicom lacks clarity - â€œgoalposts moveâ€ unlike traditional consultancies
- Interested in BrandTech Group meeting (will reach out to Emma or accept introduction)

### WeAreUnknown Business Opportunities

- Omnicom as potential client for executive search and freelance talent
- Focus on freelance particularly attractive - no one wants full-time hires currently
- Alex sees need for â€œsystematized freelance approachâ€ vs ad hoc hiring
- Suggested introductions:
  - Troy (primary contact) - wait until post-merger chaos settles
  - Amy (alternative) - might have competitive conflicts
  - DDB specifically for freelance opportunities
- Geographic scope: UK/US strong, ANZ possible for executive search only

## My Notes


## Full Transcript
 
Me: Very well. Thank you, sir. I'm very well. Oh, I'm just doing my well, Teams is a bit of a new weird setup.  
Them: Yeah. It just updated. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Okay. Hi. Yeah. Cheers. Scott. Down. Okay. This is new to me. Yeah. Every time I get a team, I always What what what you  
Them: What what what do you what do you normally use?  
Me: what what do you know? Google Meets. Do know what? We used to be this weird  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: classic independent business? We used to be like Slack, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Google Drive, like everything was scattered everywhere.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And the consultants who came in and they were like, you've just got pick something.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That makes sense here because this is a weirdly because of that, and it's so classic  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. That's right.  
Me: fang like now, if I ever go into a Teams call, it's fifty fifty. Because we deleted our three six five membership, they won't let me use my new Google password to get in. And so I'm like, oh, I get stuck in a loop being like, can't count on this call.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Hell.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're all they're all trying to  
Me: Trying to keep us  
Them: us in their walled gardens. Right?  
Me: A 100%, man. God. It's man. How are you doing? What's been going on?  
Them: Yeah. Good.  
Me: Man. I'm  
Them: I mean, had a good, good summer, and,  
Me: time. Get some  
Them: I mean, we are revving up. For a, fucking wild q four. Right?  
Me: Yeah. Tell me more. I saw James Rowe recently.  
Them: Oh, you did? Yeah.  
Me: Yes. So got some updates there. I'd love to know what's been what's been going on.  
Them: Well, I think that'll be five looks. Right?  
Me: Well, Right?  
Them: You know? I think it's, look. It is  
Me: Let  
Them: how how should I put it? I think  
Me: it  
Them: it it has to  
Me: slipped.  
Them: result in a relatively large amount of structural change.  
Me: Structural change. Yeah. Right?  
Them: Right? Because otherwise,  
Me: Because all of my you tell me  
Them: you don't  
Me: you know,  
Them: you know, the street won't accept it.  
Me: Right? Like, the street  
Them: Right? Like, the street has gotta see  
Me: is see  
Them: you know, we've promised basically, between the two companies, we promised  
Me: Yeah. We've basically. Between two.  
Them: a billion dollars of synergies, right, which is a billion dollars of savings, which is a billion dollars of headcount.  
Me: Million dollar. Yeah.  
Them: Basically.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Right? Or maybe not that much, but, you know, call it half and half. Half,  
Me: That hurt you. Cool. Operate so  
Them: you know, kind of technologies, you know, and half know, kind of people. Right? So  
Me: Right? So so we're walk back to you.  
Them: so we got a lot of anxious people. Right? And we're just telling everybody to keep their head down. You know? And you know, it'll be fine.  
Me: So  
Them: Or it won't, but, you know, the, the business will, you know, will be smarter, leaner, more functional, supposedly.  
Me: supposed  
Them: And yeah, I think debate I think debate, honestly, like, speaking candidly with with you,  
Me: yeah.  
Them: I think the  
Me: That big  
Them: big challenge will be showing the value  
Me: challenge will be. So fact that to act  
Them: to our clients.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: And not that it is just more complicated and distracting and  
Me: Just more complicated.  
Them: noisy.  
Me: Yeah. Right?  
Them: Right?  
Me: How do you do that? I mean, you even just reading the WPP AI report, which is this beautifully put together It's been very well designed. Right? But it no matter how you look at it, it's still it's still rearranging the chairs. There's not truly value being sold to a client to go, oh, yeah. The great thing is now, it's gonna be cheaper, faster, better, like,  
Them: Yep.  
Me: you can see how it's going to be easy for whichever holding company that gets their ship together in the proposition to the business. Being outcome focused or whatever it is that you however you frame it,  
Them: Yep.  
Me: You can see how that's the  
Them: Yep.  
Me: the the right play. But must be hard because you've got three different audiences. You've got the the markets, you know, what are we saying to the Wall Street?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Then we've got the talent that's working internally, and then we've also got clients. So there's three messages that you've gotta hit. And and all of them are as important as each other. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And they and they and they somewhat compete sometimes.  
Me: Yeah. Compete. Yeah. That Yeah.  
Them: I mean, the proof is in the pudding. Right? And I think you gotta, you gotta show immediately that every client is getting the love that they need. Right? And  
Me: Right?  
Them: you know, that the upside is is basically the access to talent, the access to technology. Right? And the, you know, some kind of a a forward thinking approach that shows  
Me: Thinking. Appro that should that  
Them: you are gonna get better work or you are gonna have a better structured you know, compensation deal. Right?  
Me: compensation. Right. Which does  
Them: Doesn't necessarily have to be solved right away.  
Me: mean solve right away. But  
Them: But you you have to show that we're headed there.  
Me: Yeah. Right?  
Them: Right? So if it if it is an outcomes based model,  
Me: Based.  
Them: gotta be able to say, fairly quickly this is where we're going.  
Me: Yeah. Right?  
Them: Right? And you will be  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: better served It will be cheaper. But it'll ultimately be, you know, more create more value for the company. Right? So  
Me: And  
Them: and then I don't know, maybe there's a little bit of  
Me: yeah.  
Them: you know, upside on kinda what we can  
Me: I'm sorry. We offer.  
Them: offer. Right? Like, you know, Acxiom coming in  
Me: Right? Like, you know, code.  
Them: You know? You have to show again. Relative because this is what this is what as as a client, that's what you're gonna say. You're gonna say, okay. Great. What do you guys now have that you didn't have yesterday? Right? And and you gotta be able to to show it or at least you gotta be able to plot it out. That it's coming.  
Me: What what what's the incentive to  
Them: So  
Me: the brands? Right? Because if you were to boil burn this down to the ground and take the assets, the talent, the clients, and proposition. Went, right, okay, do we design this from the beginning again? How what's the incentive for the superorganism? We we want everybody to be laddering up to the thing that is Omnicom or Omnipig, whatever the hell it's gonna be called.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. How do you  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: how do you jointly incentivize individualized brands to be integrated.  
Them: You mean across disciplines?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because arguably, you'd say I imagine it it it will probably go who has the best relationship with the brand. And therefore they own the top of the relationship and then it filters down from there. What I'm trying to work out is why would I, Alex,  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Lubar of DDB, majorly selling communications You know, I'm being Yeah. One  
Them: Yeah. Why would I cross sell?  
Me: Why would I cross sell to the media or to the or to future brands to, you know,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Or is that even the expectation?  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. I guess I'm trying to how  
Them: Yeah. You have to you have to have basically a a a compensation structure that facilitates that. Right?  
Me: Yeah. So  
Them: So you have to have a mechanism by which  
Me: cross sell  
Them: cross selling creates upside for you personally and for the business.  
Me: upside. For you. Bus. Right?  
Them: Right? And that that has not historically been in place.  
Me: And that that been placed. Right?  
Them: Right? And so so either  
Me: And so so Right? And  
Them: either you and, actually, I'd probably fall in a different I I I would probably do it a different way than than they are going to do it.  
Me: I'm  
Them: I would  
Me: would  
Them: what they probably will do is they will put brands of a similar discipline together. Right? You'll still have sector or discipline expertise. Right?  
Me: Okay. Yeah.  
Them: In that instance, right,  
Me: Right. You  
Them: you have to have a model by which you compensate right, for cross selling.  
Me: Yeah. I  
Them: I think, the and typically, those models  
Me: that more actually,  
Them: actually  
Me: they're not  
Them: they're not complicated in  
Me: Sex  
Them: sectors outside of our business, but  
Me: outside of business, but and yeah,  
Them: the advertising industry has never been very good at doing it, or the comms industry has been never been very good at it.  
Me: becomes  
Them: So the easier and I think the the the better way to do it would be to integrate the disciplines. Right? And, actually, that would be net new news. Right? Right? It's to say, okay. We're the first holding company.  
Me: that is  
Them: That is now going back to the future. Right? And we're gonna put  
Me: not Right.  
Them: media and data and creative and, you know, whatever PR, blah blah blah blah together. And then we're gonna create  
Me: Together. And creating you know, three.  
Them: you know, three best in class integrated comms offerings. Right? They'll never fucking do that.  
Me: Why?  
Them: Because okay. Now you're gonna get my real honest answer. Because they are inherently short term thinkers.  
Me: Towards the offices.  
Them: Right? Quarterly run businesses. You know, even even, you know, yearly two, three year you know, outlooks, they're not five, ten year outlooks. Right? And so  
Me: Yeah. Right. And so do  
Them: doing that kind of a construct  
Me: so do cost  
Them: right, costs you more  
Me: you you upfront  
Them: in the upfront even if it has benefits later on. Right? Mhmm. And nobody at that level wants to take the hit right away. They wanna show the market q one twenty twenty six, there's upside. And and that that's the problem.  
Me: weirdly is why I saw WPP when you've got nothing to lose,  
Them: Correct.  
Me: which in their situation is where they are,  
Them: Correct.  
Me: I I finally, I've got a call with Weareck at 05:00 today, and if someone that runs all of their exec stuff, and she the reason we've got back in contact is because I'm saying, look, you know, you really could you could have what people that would never have joined your business because they're seeing this and going, it can't get any worse. I'd rather be somewhere where it can't get any worse  
Them: Right.  
Me: because that's generally where the innovation will probably start to happen.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Whereas, you guys have got this expectation, promises that you've made, billion, you know,  
Them: Yep.  
Me: dollar savings and at the same time efficiencies and, you know, betterment of of of relationships.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: That's a lot of promise. And and and the be the person delivering that promise is gonna be hard now. Whereas Well, it's  
Them: Well and it's not it's not it's not  
Me: fine. Not. Attractive to talent.  
Them: attractive to talent. Right? Whereas WVP could say,  
Me: Right? Whereas say, yeah. Probably  
Them: yeah. We've bought we bottomed out.  
Me: we pulled it down. With  
Them: But  
Me: something.  
Them: we're gonna do something radical.  
Me: Yeah. Do you break it?  
Them: Do you wanna get in on the ground floor and let's go build the future?  
Me: The future. Yeah. Where it's  
Them: Whereas, you know, that's not what  
Me: you know? That's not what Saturno here.  
Them: happening over here.  
Me: Say that'd be cool to see at WPP. I don't think it is actually happening. Still think they're gonna do the same thing they've always done. They might  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: you know, put different curtains on the on the building or whatever the saying is.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I don't know. We'll we'll see. It's be interesting. So, okay, two two questions because I wanna make sure Yeah. Well, there's three questions. Number one is how the hell can I make it up to you from our fucking can balls up? Was  
Them: Don't worry about me. Yep. Yeah.  
Me: have a choice. I have an idea on that.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: And where you it depends on your answer to the second question on how  
Them: Yep.  
Me: far you want to go on that thing. And then my second question is you  
Them: Yep.  
Me: are we thinking where are we the conversation that we have? Yeah. At Jack Weiss Frieda?  
Them: Yep.  
Me: We had that lovely American baseball fan asking about my jacket. Yeah.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Yeah. Where are we on that spectrum of in, out,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: curious I think at that time, you were, you know, keen to see how this is gonna play out. Open to anything that might be shaped differently where you're given real autonomy,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: empowerment, and, hopefully, the right financial upside?  
Them: Yep. Mhmm.  
Me: I I that's that's probably not changed. And then the third question is more of a selfish question. I want to get a good gauge on  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Omnicom when it's talent. Problems because we are we have just gone through a huge repositioning and restructure here where we designed three different products and I'm trying to work out if Omnipig is gonna be the right place to sell them to, and I'd love to get your feedback on whether that's  
Them: Sure.  
Me: Sure. Likely or not. Sure. Cool. So, yeah, those are my  
Them: Those are the three juicy questions.  
Me: my my first actually. Over  
Them: So don't listen. Don't worry about Ken. I I get it. It happens. A it's a wild week, so don't don't fret over it.  
Me: So don't don't fret. Thank you.  
Them: Question two,  
Me: Question two. Yeah. I mean,  
Them: yeah, I mean, I'm all ears. Right? I mean, I I've I've  
Me: right. I mean, I I I I've got a bunch  
Them: I've got a bunch of different conversations going. I don't  
Me: different conversations gonna and I don't you know, the  
Them: you know, the the short answer is  
Me: the  
Them: even if I win, I something they think is interesting  
Me: I think they something.  
Them: is put in front of me. Right?  
Me: I'm sure.  
Them: I'm not sure I really win.  
Me: Take care.  
Them: Because I think that the next two years are gonna be a very  
Me: I think that the two I think be a very tricky two years.  
Them: tricky two years for  
Me: On the call. Right?  
Them: Omnicom.  
Me: That's  
Them: Right? That's gonna be  
Me: a lot  
Them: a lot of it's  
Me: Like,  
Them: like, the you know, these these  
Me: Right?  
Them: mergers, right, are  
Me: It  
Them: ugly  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: things. Right? And you need to have  
Me: Right. And you  
Them: you need to have fantastic  
Me: need fun  
Them: leadership at the top.  
Me: top. Right.  
Them: Right, that is visionary,  
Me: Vision.  
Them: in order to  
Me: I the course  
Them: plot the course and bring the talent along. And  
Me: the time. Hello? And  
Them: and I think as we've just said, unfortunately, I think what we've got is we've got short term financial managers. Right? Right at the top. And so it's it's it's it's  
Me: difficult to get it. Yeah.  
Them: a little bit difficult to get excited.  
Me: What's your I'm curious to know this because  
Them: Right?  
Me: Toby Southgate went through a situation where that was the case. Right? There was what he was being told with his major KPI. And what the holding co is probably gonna do anyway. Despite however well he would have done on that KPI. And it happens the whole time in in holding companies.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Yep. Do you think there is a delta between what you're being told is expected of you versus what they actually want you to do. Yeah.  
Them: I think that's probably the lack of clarity. Yeah. I think there's a lack of clarity there. I mean, I think the  
Me: I think they  
Them: I think that it is not I mean,  
Me: I mean,  
Them: you know, you may you may have heard this from other olliecom people, but it it is not a particularly  
Me: claim  
Them: clear and robust  
Me: system.  
Them: system of reward, right, where  
Me: Right. Weareck. Then stick to the group.  
Them: they stick to the rules.  
Me: Right? Okay.  
Them: Right? They it's it's a little fungible.  
Me: It's it's a little fun. Okay.  
Them: Right, depending on  
Me: On it. Yeah.  
Them: yeah, depending on how the company does, depending how John's feeling. You know? It's like yeah. No. So it's not As opposed to, you know, you go to the big consultancies. Right? And they're like,  
Me: Yeah. Now. Yeah. That's yeah. Yeah.  
Them: hit this. Get that. Yeah.  
Me: Okay. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: You know? Yeah. It's a little  
Me: Marriedocratic. It's a yeah.  
Them: it's a bit of yeah. The the goalposts move a lot more.  
Me: So  
Them: So so I I'm  
Me: so I I'm I'm Okay.  
Them: I'm very open to different things. Right? And and I think that I'm open but I I had I would not I am not open to going  
Me: Right.  
Them: one of the other holding companies. That's not interesting to me. You know? I mean, even it it would have to be unlike the WPP side. I mean, you would it would really have to be a convincing sell on wanting to do something that different.  
Me: Sound.  
Them: But, otherwise, I mean, my point of view on the business is that is you don't really need these Goliath holdcos or networks, right, to service  
Me: Right. Just I love this.  
Them: a lot of the business that our our clients need. What you need is  
Me: I applied to.  
Them: best in class talent, supported by, you know, technology that is found you know, foundational and, you know, net new. Right? And so  
Me: And so  
Them: the combination of those two things means that you you can be a much smaller entity and still delivering the more interesting stuff. I mean, maybe you need some scale to do some of the long tail stuff or maybe the, you know, the broader media buying. But, I mean, like, other than that, right, all of the really interesting stuff can be done with small groups. Right?  
Me: 100%. Weirdly, we're we're seeing  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: things that I've actually seen recently where I've gone, that's actually quite interesting. Had a meeting with Jellyfish, who are owned by Brown Tech Group, You and mister Jones, David Jones, that guy. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. That was  
Them: Yep.  
Me: that was genuinely the first time I've met a business utilizing AI for creativity. And not wagging on about that being the thing. They've bought the proprietary tech of of pencil. Have you heard of pencil?  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Fine. So they've and that's used across  
Them: Yep. Who did you talk to, Who  
Me: we I met with Natalie Winford who  
Them: yeah.  
Me: is the COO of the creator part of Jellyfish. Which I think is really interesting.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And out of all of the groups that I've had a conversation with, other than, like, I think common interest in what they're building in a localized way is nice. Is it  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: crazy scalable Probably not. Anthony is doing the job that I think you would do or get there. Then he's founded it and taken private equity money to to put that group together. And and and it, you know, that reflects him in in a good way. Other thing that I've seen that is I would love to see in in in another neo holding co setup Have you heard of a Superside or Janeiro or any of these types of businesses? Yeah. Yeah. I'm  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I know the superside.  
Me: superstaric. Superstaric? Right. Yeah. So we work with  
Them: I don't know Genera. Yeah.  
Me: we we did a CFO search for Suicide recently. So I know all of the financials and and, you know, the modeling and everything else. What I don't think anyone has done has brought a company like that that is, you know, entirely set up for scale and have managed to make it work with the best hardest to work  
Them: Is that sue suicide or generic?  
Me: Both, to be honest. Genero Genero is probably a little bit more production heavy, but I think they  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: can get involved in the creator side. What I would love to see, and I'm just talking what's the word? Proactively, speculatively here. I've not seen anybody put that together with  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: a creative company.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: That is, you know, able to speak at that level to then tie those two things together. Because that back up what you're saying. You get all of the scale of a holding company with none of the overheads.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: And you have a lean well run creative, strategic consultancy  
Them: Yep.  
Me: that then goes straight out to the scale that's already been designed. I quite like that about BrandType because that's  
Them: Yep.  
Me: before I came onto the school, was like, what do I think Alex should do? Yeah. Probably not join another holding co unless it's the top child. And and you have true autonomy. Or and and it goes back to what I said originally. Go to a group that needs an orchestrator of think have genuine differentiation and scale potential,  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: for the right reason not because we're rearranging chairs on a Titanic. Yeah.  
Them: Mhmm. Yeah.  
Me: And I  
Them: Totally agree with that. Totally agree with that.  
Me: I would definitely say if you're not in with group, that would be a good one. Have you had a conversation there yet or not? With anyone at BrandTech?  
Them: With who? You know, I haven't, but I actually would like to. I'd like to I've I've not met David.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: Before. I mean, I know Emma very well because I used to work with Emma,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: at BBH. But I would  
Me: To.  
Them: I'd love to have a conversation if that's if you could make an introduction or if you I mean, I  
Me: Hire me  
Them: guess I could reach out to Emma.  
Me: I I know George really well, who's the cofounder. Do know George Press? Do you remember George?  
Them: And David. But those yeah. I don't I don't who who?  
Me: He cofounded do know what? He's he's exited and well, he's still a minority shareholder. He cofounded you and mister Jones with David. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Grew out to being what it is. I know George Weare. I don't know David personally, but if you  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: look, if you have a direct line to Emma, I would just say, ping Emma or sing and see how she's doing. If you would prefer me, then just pop me a note.  
Them: Yeah. I'll reach out to Ollie, but that's definitely I mean, I'm tracking with what you're saying. I mean, I think they're doing interesting stuff. I think the I think  
Me: Think They're just about the IPO, by the way. I wonder if  
Them: I mean,  
Me: it could be  
Them: yeah, I'll take it on. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. They're they're gonna IPO next year. And what what they're gonna do is I think they'll cleverly probably disintegrate a few of the brands. And they'll have brand tech creative, which would be jellyfish, and they'll have brand  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: media. I think they'll do the the snot thing. That either means it's a really good  
Them: Wait. Why is that the small thing?  
Me: Because I think they need to have this multitude of different brands because the front doors should be much clearer to their clients.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: They They're enterprise wide, so it should be how clients speak media, creative, analytics, what, you know, whatever the the client wants. So I I imagine they'll go to a consolidated model where it's a lot easier for clients to because then they can upsell from creative into production into whatever else.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Whereas at the moment, it's like, I was working with you and mister Jones, now I'm working with  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Splash or is it Jellyfish? Like,  
Them: Oh, it's confusing.  
Me: I think it's  
Them: I I I think their I think their overall proposition is very confusing.  
Me: think that I think that's the problem. I'm being I'm shouting, so I'm gonna go in my in my office. One sec.  
Them: Yeah. No worries.  
Me: It's funny that I get told off. That was yeah. That's definitely one of the interesting ones. Where else where else have you spoken to that's been interesting?  
Them: Well, I mean, there are a couple places that I have to I have to keep  
Me: Can say places like  
Them: to myself. But, yeah. There are couple of but there there there are there are you could probably work it out. But I I I this particular moment, I'd rather not name them, but there are a couple of places  
Me: But there are a couple of places far. Street.  
Them: that are very far upstream.  
Me: Okay. Right?  
Them: Right? And they're looking they have the relationships.  
Me: They're looking They have the relationships. Doing. The work.  
Them: They are doing the work, the upstream work,  
Me: And now they just  
Them: and now they just have to decide  
Me: have to decide what it is that they  
Them: what it is that they wanna build out.  
Me: build out. Right? And then they build out.  
Them: Right? And do they build out  
Me: Yeah. Crazy.  
Them: you know, creative, not in a traditional way? But in, you know, the the whatever the modern construct is. Do they go all the way through delivery? Maybe, maybe not. If there's not great margins in delivery anymore. Right? Or do they continue to kinda go further upstream? Maybe you could do all of it. So there there are a couple one in particular, a place that that really has a lot of interesting opportunity there where they've got the it's the beginnings,  
Me: The I guess  
Them: of what, I guess, sort of what BrandTech has done. Although I think BrandTech I don't know, I I think they  
Me: so.  
Them: very interesting place, but I think that they've it in a very confusing way, at least to the marketplace. Makes a lot of sense to them internally.  
Me: Stop.  
Them: So  
Me: Okay. That's exciting, though. So if it this is where  
Them: it's very exciting, but I I like but if you've got  
Me: if you've got something  
Them: somebody that you want me to meet, I will I would meet.  
Me: Okay. Yeah. I think the route  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: you're going the same mean, you and I spoke about this, so it's super clear. You need to be Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Higher up the food chain, almost to a consultancy level. Where there's capital you know, maybe not yet resource, but there's clients saying we would do this if you had this this here. Versus going to yet another place where you've you've won this game in  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: advertising communications, integrated da da da da da. Now you should be getting  
Them: It's a bit boring.  
Me: upside. Yeah.  
Them: It's a bit and you know what it is? It's tiring and boring, which is not a good combo.  
Me: So  
Them: Alright. So question number three, because you know they go  
Me: my question it's not  
Them: we've only got five minutes. So what do I think? I think  
Me: I think  
Them: I think it would be a great gig for you to be able to get in with  
Me: I think  
Them: Omnicom, especially at this moment. You had had some conversations with them. Right? But they didn't really go anywhere?  
Me: It was the wrong people. It was to we had, like, a a talent. I think you introduced him to, like, the head of talent at Adam and Eve or at DDB. Yeah. Love the  
Them: Oh, yeah. That but that was small.  
Me: But but I  
Them: But but, like, didn't you weren't you already talking to, like, Amy?  
Me: Haven't met Amy yet. No. No. I didn't meet Amy. I've I've introduced  
Them: And it  
Me: been introduced to people like Monica Torres and people that it just felt look, at the end of day, they don't unless you're at the top of the table, what we're selling as a solution is kind of against some of the stuff that they are doing. And it and it's not nice to hear from if you're a head of talent, there's this a company that are promising you Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. You're competitive. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Exactly. So how to get introduced probably is Amy because she has such a complex problem across the group. She wants to find a place where she can have a consistent solution. And the two solutions that we would sell would be the exact thing, but also freelance. Weirdly, when we reviewed this, we've gone actually it's funny, like you were saying, production. We sell upstream. We do chair people roles, CEOs, and exec search stuff.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But that's lumpy revenue. Where there's consistent revenue is actually in freelance.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Where the need is consistent, the quality is very high, and getting the right people at the right  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: time in the right place is really tough.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: So what we would love to do is, like, either say to Omnicom, we want to win your entire creative freelance thing or we would love to be  
Them: Yep.  
Me: you know, briefed or and an exec search level across The US and The UK. That would be the ideal for us.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because we know that we'd add value. But, I mean, you tell me if that's gonna be valuable to them.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, I think the  
Me: I think. Think  
Them: I think both are interesting. I think the I think well, I think the freelance thing is particularly  
Me: well, think  
Them: because nobody wants to hire full time in this company right now unless you're doing a very unique  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: positions. Right? But, like, virtually,  
Me: Positions. Right.  
Them: there are very few positions like that. Right? And so that idea, there is an ongoing freelance construct that gets you the best talent, right, but gives you the flex that you need. Is is certainly a thing that that is attractive. I mean, I think the the thing, Ollie, is you've gotta work out how are you positioning yourself against the others. Right? So against the other,  
Me: You know, competitive rate. It's not  
Them: you know, whatever, you know, competitor, your exec search competitors or know? And I I I end this understand. I think I understand how you're different. I mean, I understand how you personally are different.  
Me: understand how you I I  
Them: You know, I think I'd I'd like to understand how the company is different. And organize and and operates in a different way. And then  
Me: operates in a then from  
Them: you know, I mean, the best thing  
Me: then  
Them: is for me to make an introduction to Troy.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: Right? I mean, that that's probably the guy you should be. I mean, Troy,  
Me: Perfect. Troy  
Them: or maybe Deepki or Amy depending on you know, access. It's gonna be a bit difficult probably the next month You could get to Amy You could I can get you to Amy very quickly. I  
Me: She running.  
Them: she just you might run into a competitive issue there. You're better getting to Troy. You might just need to wait a little bit  
Me: Just in the  
Them: Right? Just because it's a little bit of a  
Me: Just Right.  
Them: a madhouse at the moment. Right? But I that's who you should that and I can help  
Me: I I appreciate that. I just  
Them: sort that out for you.  
Me: it needs to be, and by the way, I can tell you a million ways as how we're different to our competitors. The easiest way to do it is the graph. Like, you've got inch wide, mile deep, exact search companies, normally one man balance, two, you know, whatever.  
Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.  
Me: And then at the other end, you've got the freelance end, which is very pile them high, sell them cheap, no taste.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: Inch deep, pile wide. 're right in the center of those things.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because we do sea level searches around the world, but also we have a scale team that are specialists. So that's the biggest difference. The thing that we saw is that you can be both.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: But you've got to pick three or four different disciplines to specialize in. So that's how we've added more value. That's how we're  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: you know, faster, more effective. So, yeah, we don't we don't struggle when it comes to positioning. The hardest thing is to go we're both exec search, but we also run curated freelance ventures  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: that are deep. Does that make sense?  
Them: No. No. It may it makes loads of sense. I think what you put  
Me: Say,  
Them: but I would say like, a Grace Blue would try and say the same thing.  
Me: Right. Oh, no. Mean, if they are, that would be crazy because there are about five people now. But  
Them: Right?  
Me: Grace Blue are exactly why we built this business to go against. Because they're inspired mile deep only doing exec search. And generally only in advertising. We're in branding, advertising, social influence.  
Them: Yeah. But they now say they've got that AI offering. Right? They can do the freelance piece. Right?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'm not saying they can deliver what they say.  
Me: Yeah. Did they say we could do the freelance piece?  
Them: But I am I mean, they they've claimed it. Right? I mean, I I we haven't used it. Right? But they I don't know.  
Me: Click  
Them: Like, I but what I would say is  
Me: I  
Them: I think the specificity of why you can get  
Me: Yeah. When  
Them: to certain people  
Me: Right.  
Them: when others can't.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Right, is very attractive.  
Me: So it's like  
Them: Right? So it's like, this is why we could get this talent.  
Me: this is why we can get this Mhmm.  
Them: When ordinarily others  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: can't.  
Me: That's  
Them: You know? And that that's the bit that  
Me: the big thing.  
Them: you know, because even, like, however you position the construct, it yeah, the high and low or however you wanna describe it,  
Me: Describe Yeah. I think  
Them: I think the exam I think the specificity of why  
Me: specificity is why It's for  
Them: certain talent is inaccessible unless you have  
Me: with. That  
Them: the right conduit. I think it's, like, it it is is is very compelling. But, look, I I gotta run, but why do we do this? I, I mean, I I talk to Troy all the time. Let me find the right time to bring it up. Right? Is there anything that you do do you have a and and then, by the way,  
Me: I think  
Them: I think there's other stuff. Probably with just DDB. Especially on the freelance side.  
Me: outside The challenge  
Them: The challenge is you could you do freelance  
Me: is Just  
Them: just US, UK. Can you do broader than that or not?  
Me: How broad? LatAm? Like it.  
Them: Like, could you do a and z?  
Me: Australian I mean, that's the only other place that we do. Yeah.  
Them: Australia, New Zoom?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You  
Them: Yeah. Okay. You do you know New Zealand really well or not? Like,  
Me: with No. No. No. We would we would have  
Them: I mean, do you have someone out there?  
Me: way more impact if we were doing UK, US. ANZ, I mean, if we're doing a a locked in excuse yeah. Then we can do that. We've done many surgeries for Calenso, da da da But it depends if it was are we talking freelance or executive? If it's freelance, I would say that's not a good place to trial our relationship. But if it was US freelance, UK freelance, easy,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: If it if it was an exact situation, yes.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That's yeah. Not hard for us. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. The exact stuff. No. I was thinking more about the the freelance  
Me: Because that's  
Them: stuff as well because because, actually, I've been talking very specifically to some of our leaders about  
Me: building  
Them: building a more robust freelance model knowing  
Me: building  
Them: that we can't have a ton of new full time hires, right,  
Me: What is of approach  
Them: What is a systematized way  
Me: doing  
Them: of approaching freelance as opposed to  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: doing it in an ad hoc fashion. Right?  
Me: But let me I  
Them: But let me okay. So I leave that with  
Me: leave that because I think that it probably is  
Them: because I think there probably is a UK, US conversation we had there.  
Me: And then  
Them: And then I think that is a conversation at some stage to be out of Detroit.  
Me: Yeah. Great. I'd love that. Thank you. That's and I will get you we work on the position  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And then  
Me: everything else. But I I think you're gonna  
Them: yeah, and then if you've got any, any interesting introductions, on your end, I'm Ollie's.  
Me: Absolutely. Cool. Alright, sir. Alright. Nice catch up. See you soon.  
Them: Alright. Cheers, man. Talk you later. Bye.  
Me: Bye bye.
