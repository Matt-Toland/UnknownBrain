Them: Who's on?  
Me: Hey, everyone. How are you doing?  
Them: Good. How are you?  
Me: I'm good. I'm good. I'm just getting a call from Texas. That's  
Them: Oh, it should not be.  
Me: none of you guys are, is it? I don't know. That's random. Should not be.  
Them: No.  
Me: I'm gonna decline that. That feels scary. How how are you though? How's the week going?  
Them: Incredibly busy.  
Me: Really?  
Them: Always well, I was off.  
Me: Oh, yeah. Well, where did you go?  
Them: On oh, I did stuff around home, Massachusetts.  
Me: Okay. Nice. Nice.  
Them: Like Cape Cod.  
Me: Oh.  
Them: Islands, you know, just real summer in New England sort of stuff. You know?  
Me: I mean, that sounds great. That that's the sometimes the problem with The UK is you kind of have to go. Somewhere else in Europe to, like, treat it as a vacation. It's all just a little bit all too close.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But oh, no. That sounds great. I mean, we we also Yeah. We had a work like, incentive trip. I don't know if we mentioned this on our last call, but we went to went to Dubrovnik in Croatia. Which is I don't know if have either of you been.  
Them: Oh, no. But I've seen  
Me: Oh my It's like high on the recommendation list.  
Them: Same.  
Me: It's it's so great. The scenery, like a mixture of mountainous rocks and just lovely sea blue water. Yeah. It's I'd highly recommend But, yeah. So we kind of had a bit of a bit of time off as well to detach So yeah, I feel like this this call is well timed, to be honest, because last week, it would have been quite difficult.  
Them: Well and thank you for moving. I thought I would have it together for Tuesday.  
Me: No. Don't be silly.  
Them: Just did not So let me jump right in.  
Me: Yeah. A 100%. Yeah.  
Them: I will go through kind of trying to answer the questions you had put for put to me, after our last call. Alayna's here. Sorry. I should have introduced Alayna. Alayna is our senior recruiter. She handles all of our freelance hiring. So she has a lot of insights into what our tools like and dislike. And we will I will put together a doc of some of our team's favorite contractors so you can kind of see books. I have not gotten to it yet.  
Me: That is totally fine.  
Them: We'll get to it eventually.  
Me: That's perfect.  
Them: With that, you also very visual people, and having that visual will help. Okay. So kind of starting off, you asked, like, what does the world need to know about  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Instrument that we don't talk So, you know, we like to say we're builders, not vendors. So Instrument is not just a design agency. We are creative or strategic or technical partner. Who builds what matters. So we'd like to solve ambiguity and ambiguity  
Me: That's the tough one, to be fair.  
Them: Whoo.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: You're such a nice and exciting words, and you're like, that doesn't sound word. Solid and figuratively. I can't I can't do it.  
Me: No. But, hey, I know what you mean. Know you're getting at. I can't either. I'm not even gonna try. I'm just gonna say yes, move on with that other word.  
Them: Enable systems and action you know, not kind of decks and buzzwords. We build with and not for, so clients bring us in for more than just execution. They rely on us through rely on us for thought partnership. Vision setting, you know, brave creative leadership. This is true across all of our teams and our freelance talent. We don't think AI is a threat. It's a tool. So we don't fear AI, but we also don't worship it. We integrate it meaningfully, and this is something we've been doing this year for sure, like, really investigating how we can use it. You know, from custom layout generators and brand voice assistance to kind of scaled transcreation systems. And we've already we're already shipping AI powered work and not just, like, theorizing on it. We've even even integrated it for some of our in house systems, which has been really fun for, like, people ops and love it. Freelancers, we really consider our full time team members. So they get integrated into our cross disciplinary pods. They're not siloed. I think I mentioned this  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: last time we talked. So they really collaborate closely with our full time staff and our client facing when needed. And often become repeat partners. When we find someone our teams love, we will go to them again and again. And again and again.  
Me: Yeah. Good to know.  
Them: So it's kind of I mean, we truly rely on our freelancers. I guess, kind of, we wanna be known for our strategic map and maybe weird energy. So we're really rigorous and inventive. We build from systems thinking and brain clarity, but we seek out emotion, experimentation, and cultural reference. So good UX is not mean sterile UX.  
Me: That's good. Good to know, by the way, because I feel like  
Them: What  
Me: right now the talk of talent the the conversation that's going on in product design right now, especially in UX, is like the lack of invention. And the reliant on AI in a negative way. And I think that's where  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: that's where I can really feel it with you guys is that you see it an extension and a tool because of the nature of what Instrument do, which is is so inventive with every product that you build. And design, you know. And I think that's where that's who stands out. Is the agencies that are doing the best work. It's the ones who aren't just process driven, very structured in in how they build things from a UX perspective and a visual perspective. And you leverage tools, AI tools, not heavily heavily rely on them.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Or be replaced by them. You know?  
Them: Yep. Absolutely. There's some thought leadership pieces on our .com one specifically around AI that's interesting. And I think got quite a bit of attention. Question was, what do you want Instrument to be known for in the next twelve to twenty four months? Easily saying that the agency leads through creative intelligence, We wanna be seen as an agency that balances brave ideas with operational excellence. We leverage leveraging, like, AI data systems intentionally, not sort of generically. You know, we have a master class in product brand convergence. Instrument is one of the few shops that truly integrates product design, brand expression, and emerging tech. In one body of work. So that's kind of our unique strength, and we're really trying to lean into it. We want to be an agency that makes brands feel again. So kind of in a say sea of, like, gray digital sameness, we're pushing back against template culture. So we're reviving kind of the sole end product experiences through emotional storytelling, bold creative risks, and systems that enable experimentation. We've really been trying to push our people, like, in pitches Like, don't just go for what you think the client will want. Like, show them something different, something that you're really excited about. And if doesn't land, that sucks. But, like, don't regret not putting all your, like, best ideas into that pitch. You know?  
Me: Yeah. Definitely. I feel like there's a lot of the kind of yes man card doesn't doesn't work. Or it's it's if you wanna if you call your it depends how you position yourselves, but as someone who's like deep specialists, consultative, you know, nature, you've got to be able to push back and and land your own idea and why you think that's is what will solve the problem. So yeah, that's But that's tough, right, also to  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: to educate your team on that. But I was gonna ask, like, is freelance and perm, do you rely quite heavily on, like, senior level ICs? Or is it more do do you filter down quite junior, or how does that look?  
Them: No. I can't even think of a time we've used  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: anyone junior. Mid level, every once in a while, But if it's mid level, they have to be pretty autonomous. I would say senior level up. There are times we do need folks in a leadership capacity. So, like, a design director here someone who leads the work and is less people leading, whereas, like, an associate creative director is someone who yes, also leads the work, but has more, like, people management just to kinda give you an idea. But like, those so they're at the same level, but there's just, like, a different  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: differentiation in, like, people management. And then you know, there are times where we need to bring in high level support Like, it may be because we have someone on sabbatical or parental leave or something like that. But that's less common. So I would say senior to design director mostly. Vermont, I mean, did did you say you do production?  
Me: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. That yeah. That's what I assumed. It's more of, like,  
Them: I'm sorry. When I say production, I mean, like, project management.  
Me: Do do you do you have any I assume you don't There's no product management title Right? It's just project.  
Them: No. But we  
Me: Yeah. Okay.  
Them: are kind of we are needing more technical producers So I feel like that kind of starts going to that realm, and that is something that our  
Me: Is that mainly for the Google team, or is that just across the  
Them: teams are asking for more. And actually,  
Me: the cool.  
Them: For our product team rocket, They're need our and I'm requesting technical producers. I know it has  
Me: What?  
Them: Wizard even asked for technical producers?  
Me: Really?  
Them: Not like. No. Yeah. We only have I think we only have one person in house who he, like, sits on our development team and is through tech producer. We have other folks who have experience in technical projects, but it there is it's a different role from, like, being a product someone who is experienced in product work as a producer and being a technical producer. And so we are trying to, like, recognize that difference. So that is at times a need, not heavy, but it comes up. And then in, like, production support, we've got need quite have needed quite a bit lately, and I would say senior producers Seniors and EP, would you say, Alayna? Yeah. So it's senior production and then executive producer. That's the next level. It's in terms of freelance, it's hard to explain the difference because much of what an EP does in house is more client facing. They're doing a lot they, like, have to build them try to build the business and all of that. Like, the the jump from producer to EP is  
Me: Really?  
Them: massive.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But in terms of freelance, I think there is they're expecting less like, they should be. It's just more in seniority and being able to manage that client effectively. There's, like, more of the client facing  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: even though a senior producer may also sell be client facing. I can get you  
Me: No. No. That's really that's really helpful to know because I think, like,  
Them: better descriptions than what I just said.  
Me: you know, if and if kinda move ahead with how we're looking to partner, think I'd I'd wanna bring Scarlet a lot closer. To that as well, who's our she heads up the whole client services division at unknown, which is by it's such a a busy part of the business right now, and I know for a fact it's solving this exact problem. Especially within like generally a digital product led agency.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So it's good to it's good to hear that. So I don't think we covered that last time.  
Them: You know, we barely scratched the surface. Because, like, our  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: design is our biggest need, period. And one other thing that we didn't talk about was motion. I don't think  
Me: It's it's something it's  
Them: How do you feel about motion designers? Is that  
Me: like our unwritten rule. Our kinda like dark night where we we don't say we do it, but we do. Kind of. So like for example, for our close partners, we'll off it mainly just in a freelance pass capacity. Just because that's where majority of our network is. But, yeah, I I know Like, we kinda went with the times of we know how important that part of a business is becoming. So, yes, we in short, we do service that, but only for, like, our locked in you know, journeys, partnerships, basically. So, yeah. And and we have a we have a specialist here. I've also got quite a big network in that world as well personally, so that's quite helpful. Yeah.  
Them: Okay. Okay. Let's maybe I'll give you kind of a rundown of our I wanna say talent requirements,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: but kind of generally what we're looking for. We already on, like, experience level Oh, maybe sometime mid, but, again, really need to be autonomous, and then senior and above. Agency background is preferred. It's agencies are faster pace.  
Me: Yeah. Exactly.  
Them: You know? And so while each agency, of course, is unique, it takes a minute for them to, like, understand, like, our flow, If they have never worked in the agency before, I feel like it's  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: harder to get into that rhythm.  
Me: I agree. Definitely agree.  
Them: Fast enough. You know? Digital first experience, I mean, must have. They have to be Ideally, they've worked with Enfigma That's the main tool we use here in our  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like, if they've worked with other AI tools, other collaboration tools, we use Slack. Else do we use?  
Me: Yeah. That's that's just it feels like it goes about  
Them: The teams use. Mean, Figma really is a big one.  
Me: saying now, doesn't it? Like,  
Them: Use Google Google It does.  
Me: yeah.  
Them: Although, I mean, I guess it's been a while. Alayna, do you find anyone these days that says they haven't worked with  
Me: Really,  
Them: Figma? No. I like it's actually, like, funny at this point. Sometimes I still ask, an interview, like, if it's someone at, like, a big agency. And I don't know. I literally just told a candidate this week,  
Me: It's a good point, though. In in some of those big legacy agencies, you know, sometimes they  
Them: need to stop asking people that because no one has told me.  
Me: stuck with old tools. But that's the thing with AI, like, know so many networks that  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: can't leverage you know, even like a mid journey or a chat TBT or whatever for their scripting or pitching process or anything because of the just the restrictions of their of their, like, internal softwares and and  
Them: Yeah. Think so.  
Me: whatever. So, yeah, it's it's interesting, but I feel like if you've got freedom to do that, I worry for the talent in those places because that's when it feels like you could get left behind  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: if you're not leveraging the tool. But I guess for me, what would be really helpful to know as well like in terms of because you know we identified the a few kind of pain points right now being volume, we wanna be higher and quality to to match that as well, which is totally fair, and and I know the solutions to that. But I think, like, I'd love to know I imagine anyone who as soon as you get on a call with them, they're pretty interested in what Instrument do and are very fond of the work they do. But, like, what's the kind of what's the story you wanna tell the freelance market? Like let's say you you are completely unknown in in London. Know, I'm speaking to someone who doesn't know who Instrument are. Like, what's the thing that you really wanna get across to to that person?  
Them: I mean, I think I covered a lot of those things about the fact  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: like, our desire to kind of be more strategic and think outside of the norm are, you know, building with our clients, not just for them. The interest in new and emerging tools, the way that we collaborate internally, and the vibe. I I hate saying vibe, but, like, general feeling here that people tend to really love.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And because we our freelancers are not siloed, they're really part of the team and we want them to be part of the conversation. That it it is a moment for them to be part of some really cool projects.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And like, doing the work and, like, being told what to do and then just doing it. Like, they're part of  
Me: 100%. And that's, like, that's so great. Because I have speak I've spoken to a lot of  
Them: solving the problem. You know?  
Me: ex freelance instrument folks, but even, you know, permanent people like the Jesse White's and so on and like just such like great things to say. Is like it's it's always so good to hear. But I feel like this is what what I what I really wanna be useful for is the people who are we wanna introduce you to people, obviously, who you haven't come across who are bringing a whole new skill set that you can leverage as well as the thing that that you do every day, they can also nail. And I wanna tell them that this is why this is why I think Instrument, I'm backing as my favorite agent for this year. Because I know they're doing x, y, zed better than anyone else. You know, and I think like culture a 100% comes into that as you said. The the output of work obviously comes into that. It's almost less about the client name and more about what's the problem this product designer or visual designer is coming in to solve. That's what's more interesting to people right now and that's like what it really feels, you know, when we're saying we wanna genuinely approach things differently and think of more inventive ways to approach product design. They're like Yeah. Yeah, what are those ways? And I wanna help because because then I'm I'm appreciated for my different style of thinking. That's again what, like, will set you guys apart from everyone else. So it's more just me being a key facilitator in in telling that story. And kinda hedging not only bringing you new new talent and more talent, but it's also educating the market on what instrument her are and going to become.  
Them: Sure.  
Me: Yeah, that's, I guess, where where I'm where I think I can help because I think the less people wanna know what you've done now I think it's it's like that's kind of it's already there. It's up on online. Like, we can see that. But I wanna know  
Them: Sure.  
Me: when I'm in the building, what's gonna change for me as well, and what am I gonna be a part of. So, yeah, the more and it's how you guys Every time I'm on a call with you, it's like it's always like, what's next, and what can we do, and what we're like, doing our we're doing our best ever in this you know, in this thing, and we wanna get better. So, yeah, it's all very, very positive, and I think, like, that's the the story that we need to convey to the talent as well. Yeah.  
Them: Great. I mean, it's true. I mean, not all agencies have a different experience. Can they be all probably pretty intense? Sure. But the culture I mean, Alayna and I truly feel is what sets us apart. People love working with our teams. Yeah. It's like after I know. I talked to so many people people, and after they work on an engagement with us, like because when I talk on the phone with them, have a little screen, always, like, you know, say talk about our culture, and we have, like, a lot of, like, humble people here who are just excited about doing good work and like, no ego. And sometimes people, like, do a little give go. Like,  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: no ego. Right. I don't And then, like, after they wrap with us, they'll come be like, Alayna. I loved working here. Like, you really it really was so true. Like, the people here  
Me: Wow.  
Them: are incredible. Like, they do mention the work of course, because we have really cool work going on. But, like, I truly do think, like, the compliments that I get from freelance is, like, I  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: love the, like, humans that are that I'm working with.  
Me: That that's amazing. And that's like like, testament to  
Them: So  
Me: the talent that you bring in  
Them: yeah.  
Me: You're bringing other people in there. Might be like five to 10 degrees away from the other person, but they also they they like align so much on so many other things, and that's what makes a really, really strong collaborative culture for so that's great. I I think for for me, like, I wanna know what because I also know time wise, we're we're probably running out of time. But what's what do we need to kind of get things moving, and what's the next step and what do you think you need need from me and us to to kinda keep the conversation flowing?  
Them: I mean, they're  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: what I foresee needing in the future mean, because we don't need support right now. Well, it depends. I shouldn't say we don't need support. Product. I think I mentioned last time, is a big need for us. If we can build our network of product designers, that would be huge. That's like, team brought it brought rocket. God. Mhmm. Take a nap today.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: Like, their focus is on product innovation, and scale. They work with Amazon, Pinterest. Discord. No. ServiceNow, they've worked on, like, some smaller relief projects like Art Power, which was building an app, like, financial app for  
Me: Wow.  
Them: artists since they built it from scratch. That was cool. So it's really, like, vision led products. Oh, they just did something that the I wanna say say. Which the team was super psyched about. So that team needs a lot of support They're also the ones that sometimes need the technical producers. Motion design, is a need right now. I'm investigating other kind of staff augmentation for motion design. So it's like  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: maybe less of an individual need. Alayna, would you say what would you say next is a more frequent ask for you? It's probably the product design. I think that's, like, my biggest pain point. Is finding product designers with, like, like, our our hiring managers wanna see really, really beautiful books.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: With, like, stunning AI UI. So and  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: finding people within our pay bands for that is tough.  
Me: It is that more that more like  
Them: And  
Me: native mobile app focused or is it more like web or blend of the two? Yeah.  
Them: Most web. We do app work. Course, but, like, we wouldn't need a designer necessarily to  
Me: Right.  
Them: have that native experience. Because if we're building something that's more on the technical side, have either our team do the the technical, and they just work in in conjunction with the creative. But, like, web for sure.  
Me: Perfect. Fine. That's probably a good thing because I know how  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: these native apps mobile product designers are becoming less and less available, weirdly. I think they're all just fully going big tech now. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: I Got it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It's it's and now I'm talking talking about our pay bands. I know I sent you over our pay bands. Those are US. Based pay bands. I have asked our CPO to review, like, what she thinks we should do for UK. Because I know that you have folks in The US you can use that for  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: but anyone in The UK and or if you think you have folks elsewhere, talk about it because I wanna get you accurate pay bands to see, like,  
Me: Yeah. For sure.  
Them: will they  
Me: And and feel free to lean on us if you need that help.  
Them: change at all?  
Me: Know, we've been doing it for long enough to know the quite the the standard sort of the low, mid, and high like you you sent over. That was really, really useful. Useful to see. So yeah, if if you need a hand with that, just just give us a shout.  
Them: No. I mean, I'm I'd be curious to say what to see what sort of rates are typically seen for your people.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And I'd want to know all in. So your percentage plus  
Me: That is no  
Them: the the freelancers  
Me: I can I can help with that?  
Them: Okay. So production is definitely in production, product is definitely the biggest need. Maybe you we have not had a need I haven't seen it. We haven't needed to bring in as many contractors recently, but UX strategy is one. Where we don't I feel like we don't have a massive network. So if there's that may come up and that is I know some people are generals and they'll do  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: products soup to nuts. We do separate it here. So the strategy is split much beginning stages. And sure our product people should, like, have some of those basics, but we're not  
Me: K.  
Them: expecting them to necessarily be building those wireframes with those prototypes. Like, that is a strategist job. That would be of interest. On I would say maybe, like, campaign or content focused designers could come up, like Wizard, the Google work, They've been doing a lot of campaign focused social projects, so that could come up. I do have, like, random needs that I tend to lean on party agencies for, like, photo retouchers,  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. And look like that's  
Them: illustrators. So that'll come up too.  
Me: weird. Know, we're here to be. Just just feel I think, the best way these partnerships work is just being really, like, over communicative with each other and being, like, running this past you and we'll be really honest with yes, we have a strong network there or no, we don't. Like, the the retouches role is probably I I I wouldn't feel confident. Take that on as unknown because it was probably what we did a few years ago. But not now. But, like, it's it's so worth, like, just running things past each other just being really open and we can be like, okay, no, but we could recommend  
Them: Yeah. Two.  
Me: someone either an individual or or an agent who would know them.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And go down that route as well.  
Them: Okay. That's awesome. And I I mean, we're okay on time, but I will send you a doc kind of outlining things I've already said so that you have it in written form. The other thing that I wanna talk about is kind of timeline time zone overlap. Currently so we have core collaboration hours from nine to two PST. We just, like, try and keep team and client meetings within those hours. Because we're distributed across The US. Now I am expecting at some point, there will be flex flexibility in how much overlap there is. So if someone is in The UK, ideally, you'd be open to working maybe EST hours, but I think that they're could be situations in the future where they're okay with less of an overlap. That's some we're we're working on it with our teams that because because our freelancers are so embedded, that is scary for them.  
Me: Yeah. Sure.  
Them: Because they're they want the people working with them, not just, like, in a you know, So it is a journey we're on with them. So probably to start, we'd be looking for folks who could like, overlap a chunk of the day. Doesn't have to be PST hours.  
Me: Yeah. Definitely.  
Them: EST or at least a significant part of EST would be likely ideal.  
Me: Understood. And I think that's, like, that's a I think it becoming more of a common thing with freelancers in The UK. Know, like they're working with US based businesses fully remote. And that's that is just it's kind of part of the gig, you know. Especially if majority of the team are over there or a lot of the clients are over there too. And hopping on to client meetings on here on the West Coast. That's kind of part of it. So, no, but it's good to know and for me to just like be over communicating with talent on that as well.  
Them: Right. I mean, the goal is to build our client base in Europe as well. So that is what also will lead to, like, a natural shift of  
Me: Yeah. That's right.  
Them: meeting people who can  
Me: Okay.  
Them: work different hours. Yeah. I mean, is that does that hopefully, that gives you a little bit more knowledge about us. Obviously, as roles come in, we can get more specific about each individual need. We will send you some examples of our favorite contractors again so you can see the books that are used  
Me: Yeah. That's perfect. And what I what I can do is I can I'm more than happy to send you over some of those those bandings in The UK or in London and in UK with with us. Fee included. And can also outline a little bit more on what the partnership could look like. If that helps, like,  
Them: Yep.  
Me: we're in a probably a good moment now to be like, there are a couple of routes we can take on how unknown an instrument could partner. One is probably more of like a longer term push that's like a six month thing that we then review or like a three to six month thing. And the other is more of like an ad hoc basis. Relationship. So what I can put that in writing so you guys can take a little look and see how that works. The longer term agreement would probably be onboarding one or two of us onto the Slack channels with the talent team and getting, like, super in there and and aligned on we need and what we're looking and what we're pipelining. For. For now and for the future. And the other one will probably be less less hands on more of an arm's length. Relationship. But I will I'll put that I'll put that in an email so it's easier to to see it. Yeah. Amazing. Well, look, so good to see you both. And  
Them: Perfect.  
Me: I will I'll follow-up  
Them: Perfect.  
Me: later today or first thing tomorrow. Cool. Alright, guys. Take care.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Bye.  
Them: So much, Sean. Thank you.
