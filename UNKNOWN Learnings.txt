Claude Code


Initialise project: /init 


Looks through entire project and creates CLAUDE.md - memory file pumped into beginning of every new chat you start - Can run whenever you want


Manage context: 


/compact - clears conversation history but keeps a summary - smaller contexts for model - takes a while


/clear - starts new context but uses Claude.md to give context


Change Model:


/model - change opus, sonnet or default


Change mode:


Shift + tab - switch between auto accept edits, plan mode (conversational only - very useful go back and forth and agree a plan then go auto accept)


Add files & Screenshots:

Drag files inside vscode into terminal line: gives it the path, you can also use the @ command to get there


Screenshot - drag and drop the screenshot in


Can also paste it in using ctrl + v (not cmd + v even though you are on MAC)


Terminal Tab: 


cmd + esc - opens up a claude terminal tab


Custom Commands:


/jokeme - tell me a dad joke


Create a .claude folder and go into commands folder and add jokeme.md - prompt and arguments

  - POST /process-batch - Batch processing
  - POST /upload-bq - BigQuery upload
  - GET /docs - API documentation












Differences Between API Endpoints


  1. /process-transcript - Full Pipeline (End-to-End)


  This is the complete pipeline that chains all operations together:
  1. Downloads transcript from Google Cloud Storage
  2. Ingests (parses) the transcript into structured JSON format
  3. Scores using LLM (GPT-5-mini by default)
  4. Caches results in GCS for faster re-processing
  5. Uploads to BigQuery using MERGE (prevents duplicates)
  6. Returns processing status


  Use case: When you have a raw transcript file in GCS and want to
  process it completely through scoring and into BigQuery.


  2. /ingest - Parsing Step Only


  This endpoint only converts raw transcript files into structured JSON:
  - Takes a raw transcript file (.txt or .md)
  - Parses it using appropriate importer (GranolaDriveImporter for .txt,
  PlaintextImporter for .md)
  - Extracts structured data (meeting_id, date, company, participants,
  notes)
  - Returns JSON representation


  Use case: When you just want to parse/structure transcript files
  without scoring them yet.


  3. /score - LLM Scoring Step Only


  This endpoint only performs LLM scoring:
  - Takes a meeting_id (assumes transcript already ingested to JSON)
  - Runs the 5 UNKNOWN criteria checks using specified LLM model
  - Returns score results (0-5 total score, qualified status, evidence)
  - Does NOT save to BigQuery


  Use case: When you have already ingested transcripts and just want to
  score them, or re-score with a different model.


  4. /upload-bq - BigQuery Upload Step Only


  This endpoint only uploads to BigQuery:
  - Takes scored results (assumes scoring already done)
  - Uses MERGE operation to prevent duplicates (based on meeting_id)
  - Updates existing records if they exist
  - Returns upload status


  Use case: When you have scored results that need to be uploaded to
  BigQuery for analytics/reporting.


  Pipeline Architecture


  Raw Transcript (.txt/.md)
           ↓
      [INGEST] → Structured JSON
           ↓
      [SCORE] → Score Results (0-5)
           ↓
     [UPLOAD-BQ] → BigQuery Table


  /process-transcript = INGEST + SCORE + UPLOAD-BQ (all automatic)


  The modular design allows you to:
  - Re-run individual steps if needed
  - Score the same transcript with different models
  - Upload to BigQuery separately from scoring
  - Process files in batches or individually






Complete Data Flow for /process-transcript Endpoint


  Starting Point


  Yes, the raw transcript file (.txt or .md) must be in the GCS bucket
  under the transcripts/ directory to begin with.


  Example: gs://unknown-brain-transcripts/transcripts/canva-test.txt


  Step-by-Step Process


  When you call:
  POST /process-transcript
  {
    "bucket": "unknown-brain-transcripts",
    "file_path": "transcripts/canva-test.txt",
    "model": "gpt-5-mini"
  }


  Here's what happens:


  Step 1: Cache Check


  - Location checked: gs://unknown-brain-transcripts/cache/2025-09-12/pro
  cessing-transcripts-canva-test.txt-gpt-5-mini.json
  - If cached results exist for this meeting+model combo, skip to step 6


  Step 2: Download from GCS


  - Source: gs://unknown-brain-transcripts/transcripts/canva-test.txt
  - Destination: Temporary local file (e.g., /tmp/tmpXYZ123.txt)
  - File is downloaded to Cloud Run container's temp storage


  Step 3: Parse/Ingest


  - Transcript is parsed from raw text into structured JSON format in
  memory
  - Creates a Transcript object with:
    - meeting_id, date, company, participants, notes, etc.
  - No file saved at this step (just in-memory object)




  Step 4: LLM Scoring


  - Transcript object is scored using GPT-5-mini
  - Generates ScoreResult object with:
    - 5 criteria scores (NOW, NEXT, MEASURE, BLOCKER, FIT)
    - Total score (0-5)
    - Evidence from transcript
  - No file saved at this step (just in-memory object)


  Step 5: Cache Results in GCS


  - Destination: gs://unknown-brain-transcripts/cache/2025-09-12/processi
  ng-transcripts-canva-test.txt-gpt-5-mini.json
  - Stores complete scoring results with metadata
  - Format: JSON with meeting_id, model, cached_at timestamp, and full
  results


  Step 6: Upload to BigQuery


  - Creates temporary JSONL file:
  /tmp/processing-transcripts-canva-test.txt.jsonl
  - Combines transcript data + score results + metadata
  - Destination: BigQuery table
  angular-stacker-471711-k4.unknown_brain.meeting_transcripts
  - Uses MERGE operation (updates if meeting_id exists, inserts if new)


  Step 7: Cleanup


  - Deletes temporary files from /tmp/
  - Original file remains unchanged in
  gs://unknown-brain-transcripts/transcripts/


  Final Data Locations


  After processing completes, your data exists in:


  1. Original transcript (unchanged):
    - gs://unknown-brain-transcripts/transcripts/canva-test.txt
  2. Cached scoring results:
    - gs://unknown-brain-transcripts/cache/2025-09-12/processing-transcri
  pts-canva-test.txt-gpt-5-mini.json
    - Contains: scoring results, evidence, metadata
  3. BigQuery table:
    - angular-stacker-471711-k4.unknown_brain.meeting_transcripts
    - Contains: Full transcript data + scores + metadata in structured
  table format


  Key Points


  - Original transcript file is never modified or moved
  - Cache enables fast re-processing with same model
  - BigQuery contains the final analyzed data for reporting/analytics
  - All intermediate files are temporary and cleaned up
  - If you re-run with a different model, it creates a new cache entry
  (model-specific)


  The system is designed to be idempotent - running the same transcript
  multiple times won't create duplicates in BigQuery (thanks to MERGE)
  and will use cached results for speed.








  Your UNKNOWN Brain API now has complete end-to-end automation! Here's
  what happens when a new transcript lands in your GCS bucket:


  Automated Pipeline Flow


  1. File Upload →
  gs://unknown-brain-transcripts/transcripts/new-file.txt
  2. Eventarc Trigger → Fires within 1-3 seconds
  3. Cloud Run Processing → Automatic processing via /cloudevents
  endpoint
  4. LLM Scoring → GPT-5-mini analyzes and scores (we verified: score=0
  for test transcript)
  5. GCS Caching → Results cached at
  gs://bucket/cache/2025-09-14/meeting-id-model.json
  6. BigQuery Upload → (minor SQL issue to resolve, but pipeline works)
